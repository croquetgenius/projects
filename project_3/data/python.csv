there's notifications for: donations, follows, bits, hosts, subscriptions, raids and gift subs! i'm still on the fence whether or not i should include a ban notification.. there's no real need to glorify a ban but the scope is there if people want it.

the next steps in the project involve integrating a feature enabling chat to leave words of encouragement or any other messages on a pixel strip board for a couple of minutes (with all the fun of banlisting regexed phrases and words to prevent the real bored folk from descending on it to leave racism!)

all of these **tasks** require live feeds of various **symbols** concurrently.

each **symbol** is a python object holding the list of **tasks** that have requested that symbol.

the **feed source** module receives hundreds of feeds every second. it has a method 'distribute()'  that segregates the incoming feed and sends it to the respective **symbol**. the **symbol** then further redistributes the feed to all the **tasks** that need it.

to achieve this parallelism i've been using **threads** of the python threading module.

the problem is that the **cpu** cannot handle more than one thousand threads at a time, throwing a **""runtimeerror: can't start new thread""**

this is my first post here or otherwise. hopefully this issue makes sense!

&amp;#x200b;

i've been burning through the automate the boring stuff udemy course with no issues i couldn't solve through some good old google research, but just recently hit a wall. i got to the web scraping module and started working through this example:

&amp;#x200b;

^(def getamazonprice(producturl):)  
^(headers = {'user-agent': 'mozilla/5.0 (macintosh; intel mac os x 10\_10\_1) applewebkit/537.36 (khtml, like    gecko) chrome/39.0.2171.95 safari/537.36'})  
^(res = requests.get(producturl,headers=headers))  
^(res.raise\_for\_status())  
^(soup = bs4.beautifulsoup(res.text, 'html.parser'))  
^(elems = soup.select('#medianoaccordion &gt; div.a-row &gt; div.a-column.a-span4.a-text-right.a-span-last &gt; span.a-size-medium.a-color-price.header-price'))

^(return elems\[0\].text.strip())  


when this function runs, all i get back is 'indexerror: list index out of range' on the final line. when all it *should* do is neatly return a price. the author had no issue doing so, and there's only one other person i've come across with the same issue. most people can run it fine it seems.

 i've tried selecting higher levels in the html, swapping the `select` method for `find` or `findall` (which return empty lists, instead of an indexerror), using different browsers to inspect elements, i've tried using different headers, made sure all my libraries/python/ide are up to date, triple-verified all the url's and element paths are right, read through the bs4 and requests documentation, tried swapping 'html.parser' for the html5lib (as the bs4 docs recommend), scoured so and reddit, reaching out to the author, and i just can't figure this one out. i thought maybe it's the way i have my environment set up, but i'm not sure how to even begin troubleshooting that.

&amp;#x200b;

to paraphrase from so, maybe the raw html i'm viewing isn't what i'm viewing in the browser. instead, the page could be executing an ajax call to load additional content, that is then inserted into the page. basically the dynamic content isn't being loaded in a way i can view it with this code. if that's true, how do i solve/verify that? 

thank you to anyone who can shed some light on this. i've been working for a few hours on solving this and am just running in circles at this point.

tldr; can't get this function to pull price information on my machine, whereas others have no problem with this exact code.",help with automate the boring stuff web-scraping example.

i'm trying to [run this script](https://gist.github.com/ferrihydrite/e96dee177614898be250457cd592517a) from github gist. i've had success with it in the past but i formatted recently and my virtualenvs stopped working. 

i'm running the script in a virtualenv with python 2.7.16 and the dependencies are librosa, numpy and scipy. the latest version of librosa doesn't install on 2.7 so i'm guessing it's not compatible older versions of python. the latest one i could get to install was librosa==0.4.2. but when i run the script i get the error messages below which i've never gotten before. it appears that there's a problem with python reading librosa properly but i'm not 100% sure if it's my setup or a problem with librosa. i just need some help to diagnose the problem and if there might be any potential solutions. thanks!

that all out of the way, i programmed the following, and when i run it, i do not get any errors however im not getting any control of these lights.  i have a couple python scripts that do work in connecting to these lights and displaying its services/characteristics/etc so i can communicate, but for some reason it is not working.  what am i doing wrong?

what can i do to get rid of this? or more fun, is it possible for me to retrieve it? what causes this, and how can i avoid it later on?

1,"hey guys, i've started learning python since 4 days ago. i saw a code today using assert statement in a function and i thought it will be a lot better if we change these codes into one that use assertionerror exception in a try/except statement. this is the code:

 def kelvin\_to\_fahrenheit(temperature):

assert (temperature &gt;= 0),""colder than absolute zero!""

return ((temperature-273)\*1.8)+32)

and my alternative is:

 def kelvin\_to\_fahrenheit(temperature):

try:

assert (temperature &gt;= 0) 

return ((temperature-273)\*1.8)+32) 

except:

print(""colder than absolute zero!"")

the reason why i thought this alternative is better is that we use try/except statement and not assert statement whenever we get any data that are external to our system. and because in this code the exception may occur due to input data, i thought this alternative may be better.

 what do you think?",assertion or try/except statement?!

1,"""guix"" is a package manager that might be interesting for mixed-languages projects, such as python extension modules which wrap third-party libraries written in other languages such as c:

https://ambrevar.xyz/guix-advance/index.html

just why i think that guix is interesting precisely for such projects :

- it offers build from source, as well as retrieval of pre-compiled binary packages. packages work exactly the same in both cases.
- currently, it has currently [around 13,000 packages](https://guix.gnu.org/packages/), many of them are very recent. guix also offers an own linux distribution, [which, when looking at standard open source packages and libraries, compares very well to arch linux](https://ambrevar.xyz/guix-advance/index.html).
- handling is similar to conda or pip + virtualenv, in general very easy (but not yet as polished and at some points perhaps requiring more experience, with the advantage of a more unified sytem)
- however it is not confined to one language or one build system, and works for many systems and languages, for example it would work superbly for a system which for example combines c, or c++ with boost libraries, python, and perhaps in future rust extension modules which replace c modules using rusts's c abi
- it supports many different build systems, among them python setup tools, make, the gnu configure / make / install, cmake,  and many more
- it can work on top of unix-like systems like debian and arch, offering up-to data library versions on top of a very stable base system. (i guess that on windows, it will require using the wsl subsystem, but as compatibility of wsl with linux improves, it should support that equally well).
- as a ""purely functional"" package manager a la nix, it offers reproducible builds and isolated testing environments. i think that it is much easier to use than nix.
- it offers a ""rollback"" functionality, meaning that if a package update ever breaks your build, you can simply go back to exactly the last previous configuration (or any previous version). the configuration you use can be put into a single file which can be version-controlled, and used on another platform. also, configurations for different projects can be completely isolated from each others; this does not only relates to python packages, but also to build tools and such.
- in difference to nix, both its configuration and implementation is done in guile, an established scheme dialect. scheme is minimalistic and easy to learn; this has the advantage of using an easy-to learn, established, very mature general-purpose language for configuration and definition of packages, if you need to add own package definitions
- as a gnu project, it is very focused on security, code integrity and the user having control over its working (non-free software is offered, but only outside the main channel)","guix, a ""functional"" package manager with rollback and good mixed-language support"

after some diging in opencv and math, i made my new pal a goalkeeper. he is not a very good one, but works ok. :)

1,"i am designing an interactive tool that helps with organizing research papers in a graph-based manner.

for instance: you start with an empty canvas, you add several research papers (i.e. new nodes in this graph - which will also hold details relevant to the paper). then you start drawing edges between these nodes that may have a custom meaning: from x cites y, to result in x is better than result in y etc. after you are done, you save this  session to a file so you can continue working later.

i started to implement something using `networkx` and `matplotlib` events, but i don't think it will scale well. i suppose that for large number of nodes it will become cumbersome to explore this graph using `matplotlib`'s canvas.

the two crucial requirements are:
- easily rendering of (possibly) large graphs (zoom in/out, `onclick` events etc)
- drawing over a previous _session_ (i.e. load a previous graphs, draw some more nodes / edges, and so on)

&amp;#x200b;

during this whole week i've been trying to make a comics viewer (i am a newbie), and now i finally ""finished"" it.

special thanks to u/aettos, u/anaverageasianboy and u/kanjirito, without whom i couldn't have achieved this project cause they answered to the questions i posted here and helped me a lot.

&amp;#x200b;

the only thing i couldn't do is zooming and panning into the images displayed when a comic book is opened.

i am open to any suggestions on the code, on the looks and everything else.

&amp;#x200b;

here's the link to download it, i also included a few .cbz comic books for you so that you can directly use the program : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oaoiccqhv5t8fj3rvpuylm\_8kahhx-ry/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oaoiccqhv5t8fj3rvpuylm_8kahhx-ry/view?usp=sharing)

\`\`\`  
\`\`\`shell script  
python server.py  
\`\`\`  
4. go to \[localhost\](http://0.0.0.0:24579/health) to check if it is start correctly.  
**### 2.3. load sample data**  
\* if you want to load soma data to play with thin project, use \`\`\`data.sql\`\`\` in this project.  
1. open datagrip, connect to mysql database;  
2. use any editor to open \`\`\`data.sql\`\`\`,copy it's content to console, execute it;  
\* using datagrip, you should get someting like this:  
!\[datagrip\](https://github.com/ruicoresci/flask-restful/blob/master/datagrip.png?raw=false)  
**## 3. rest**  
\* what is **\*\*rest\*\*** ? rest stands for **\*\*(resource) representational state transfer\*\***,it's a stateless communications protocol. the core concept of rest is **\*\*resource\*\***. in rest point of view, each concept that can be abstracted is called a resource. let's say name, age, email can be abstract as a user model,so user can be represented as a resource.   
\* transfer means resources are transferred from server side to client side.   
\* in rest world, each operation is operated on some kind of resource, and has pre-defined **\*\*verb\*\*** to describe it. such as **\*\*post\*\*** means to create a resource, **\*\*put\*\*** means to update a resource, **\*\*delete\*\*** means to delete a resource. these three verb is mainly used,you can check it out \[here\](https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api/) for more detail.  
**## 4. benefits of rest**  
\* use rest,you will get some advantages:  
1. each **\*\*uri\*\*** (or url) is for one specific resource, it makes your code clean and **\*\*\[self-describing\](**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-documenting\_code**)\*\***.basically, self-describing means what you see is what you get,you can make a quick guess about what you will get from the uri.  
2. resource is separated from view function, which means you can change your backend logic function without affect others,only if your take the same arguments and return the same resource, which is easy to achieve.  
3. it's is stateless, which means you don't need to worry about the surrounded context before you make request for resource.  
**## 5. unified response structure**  
\* using rest,we should make the response that we return **\*\*remain tha same\*\***. in most case，the response data should contains two parts: **\*\*meta\*\*** and **\*\*data\*\***.  
\* **\*\*meta\*\*** means the info about the request,is it a success or a failure ? is it successfully understood by server but that request is not allowed ?  
\* **\*\*data\*\*** means the resource that request want to get.  
\* in this project, the response  are defined as follow:  
\`\`\`python  
{  
 ""data"": data,  
 ""error\_code"": error\_code,  
 ""error\_msg"": error\_msg,  
}  
\`\`\`  
\* for example, when a request want to get a user, let's say **\*\*user 1\*\***, he may get:  
\`\`\`json  
{  
 ""data"": {  
 ""id"": 1,  
 ""name"": ""john"",  
 ""web\_site"": ""https://github.com/account"",  
 ""email"": ""hrui801@gmail.com"",  
 ""create\_time"": ""2020-05-22 13:41:49"",  
 ""update\_time"": ""2020-05-22 13:41:49""  
},  
 ""error\_code"": 0,  
 ""error\_msg"": ""success""  
}  
\`\`\`  
\* **\*\*some thing you should aware\*\***:  
\* basically,we don't directly return json data in our handler function，instead we return object.  
\* so before return to frontend we should marshal our object to json format.  
\* in flask,you can use **\*\*jsonify\*\*** function to do this,to transfer costumed data to json，you can rewrite **\*\*json.jsonencoder\*\*** function.  
\* in this project, the json.jsonencoder is rewrite as:  
\`\`\`py  
class jsonencoder(json.jsonencoder):  
 def default(self, value) -&gt; any:  
 if isinstance(value, (datetime.datetime, datetime.date)):  
 return value.strftime(""%y-%m-%d %h:%m:%s"")  
 if isinstance(value, apiresponse):  
 return value.get()  
 if isinstance(value, basemodel):  
 return value.marshal()  
 if isinstance(value, types.generatortype):  
 return \[self.default(v) for v in value\]  
 return json.jsonencoder.default(self, value)  
\`\`\`  
\* and register to flask app:  
\`\`\`py  
app.json\_encoder = jsonencoder  
\`\`\`  
\* finlay, before you return data to frontend, call \`\`\`jsonify\`\`\` function:  
\`\`\`py  
def schema(query\_model: basequerymodel, response\_model: apidatatype):  
 def decorator(func):  
 @wraps(func)  
 def wrapper(self, \*\*kwargs) -&gt; callable:  
 """"""some logic """"""  
 \# jsonify function is called here  
 return jsonify(func(self, \*\*kwargs))   
 return wrapper  
 return decorator  
\`\`\`  
**## 6. unified exception handling**  
\* exception **\*\*doesn't\*\*** means bad, on the other side, it's is crucial to let user know that they are doing something that the server can not satisfied. and they need to known why.  
\* in order to give the user corresponding error info, and to raise exception properly, this project use a file **\*\*exceptions\*\*** to clarify all exceptions  
\`\`\`py  
class serverexception(exception):  
code = 500  


class argumentinvalid(serverexception):  
code = 400  
\`\`\`  
\* you may add a **\*\*message\*\*** property to each class.  
\* we want to raise exception in our code,a exception handler function is need:  
\`\`\`py  
def handle\_exception(e) -&gt; tuple\[dict\[str, union\[union\[int, str, list\], any\]\], union\[int, any\]\]:  
code = 500  
 if isinstance(e, (httpexception, serverexception)):  
code = e.code  
logger.exception(e)  
exc = \[v for v in traceback.format\_exc(limit=10).split(""\\n"")\]  
 if str(code) == ""500"":  
send\_dingding\_alert(request.url, request.args, request.json, repr(e), exc)  
 return {'error\_code': code, 'error\_msg': str(e), 'traceback': exc}, code  
\`\`\`  
\* then register to app:  
\`\`\`py  
app.register\_error\_handler(exception, handle\_exception)  
\`\`\`  
\* **\*\*note\*\***: if you want to raise exception directly in your code and don't want to write exception handler function, all exceptions **\*\*must be\*\*** subclass of **\*\*werkzeug.exceptions.httpexception\*\***  
**## 6. unified query model, response model and databasemodel**  
\* in object oriented programming, it's better to keep your arguments to be a single object than many separated args. it's so in python and flask.   
\* let's say you want to query a user by it name and/or age and/or email, it's better to write:  
\`\`\`py  
 def get\_user(filter\_obj):  
 pass  
\`\`\`  
\* not:  
\`\`\`py  
 def get\_user(name,age,email):  
 pass  
\`\`\`  
**#### 6.1. this project use query model for request arguments:**  
\`\`\`py  
class basequerymodel(basemodel):  
 def \_\_init\_\_(self, \*\*kwargs: dict):  
 super().\_\_init\_\_(drop\_missing=false, \*\*kwargs)  
 """""" some logic """"""  
\`\`\`  
\* and **\*\*query model args validation\*\*** can be write in basemodel  
**#### 6.2. this project use response model for response results:**  
\`\`\`py  
class baseresponsemodel(basemodel):  
 def \_\_init\_\_(self, \*\*kwargs):  
 super().\_\_init\_\_(\*\*kwargs)  
 """""" some logic """"""  
\`\`\`  
\* **\*\*don't forget to jsonify your response model before return to frontend\*\***.  
**#### 6.3 this project use orm for managing database**  
\* **\*\*object-relational mapping\*\*** is used for communicate with database,it free you from writing sql statements, keeps you **\*\*coding in objected way\*\***.  
\`\`\`python  
from flask\_sqlalchemy import sqlalchemy  
class base(db.model, surrogatepk):  
 """"""database model that contains crud operations""""""  
\_\_abstract\_\_ = true  
 """"""some logic that all subclass should inherited """"""  
\`\`\`  
**#### 6.4 this project use alembic for updating database**  
\`\`\`py  
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative\_base  
meta = declarative\_base()  
db = sqlalchemy(model\_class=meta)  
class base(db.model, surrogatepk):  
 """"""database model that contains crud operations""""""  
\`\`\`  
\* **\*\*alembic\*\*** is kind of like git,it keeps every version of your database model. it will generate a folder \`\`\`alembic\`\`\`,\`\`\`alembic/versions\`\`\`,all versions are stored in \`\`\`versions\`\`\`.  
**## 7. swagger or not swagger**  
\* swagger provide an automatic way to generate documentation，so you don't need to update your docs yourself. web frontend developer can check it out for developing.  
\* but in my experience，fronted developer and backend developer discuss product requirements before developing，automatic generated docs are not specified enough to declare requirements. so this project don't use it.  
\* if you want to use swagger,check it out \[here\](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/swagger.html).  
**## 8. structure of this project**  
!\[iamge\](https://github.com/ruicoresci/flask-restful/blob/master/flask-restful.png?raw=false)  
\* **\*\*mvc(model, view, controller)\*\*** is a typical design pattern. this porject is programed in mvc pattern, but is not strictly stick to it.  
**#### 8.1 model ( models in this project): store information about resources.**  
\* specifically, they are:   
 \* database model,**\*\*orm\*\*** is in this folder,which transfer your python object to database rows.  
 \* querymodel, arguments  organized together as one model. so frontend send args to backend, backend put them together to create a new object to do arguments validation work, because use model,some default functions can be bound to it.  
 \* responsemodel, resources that are returned to frontend.  
**#### 8.2 view (resources in this project): do routing work**  
\* views are handling routing work, when a url is request, view function know what logic function to call.  
**#### 8.3 controller (handlers in this project): do logic work**  
\* handlers are used to to logic work,such as **\*\*crud\*\*** work.  
**#### 8.4 some other folders/files**  
\* folder **\*\*exemptions\*\*** store customized exceptions file and a send error to dingding file.  
\* folder **\*\*blueprints\*\*** is used to organize all apis.  
\* folder **\*\*tests\*\*** store all **\*\*unittest case\*\***, **\*\*using test case\*\*** is a good way to keep project running well when new feature is developed.  
**## 9. n + 1 problem**  
\* query one table 10 times each time fetch one row is slow than query one table one time to fetch 10 rows.  
\* **\*\*orm\*\*** release programer from writing original sql statements,but it also introduce some new problems. the database query **\*\*n+1\*\*** problem is a common one.  
\* let's say you have two tables, **\*\*user\*\*** and **\*\*post\*\***, one user can write many posts. consider the scenario blow:  
\* **\*\*you have a page which need to show ten random users' info, and also you are asked to show all posts for each user.\*\***  
\* what will orm do in this scenario? **\*\*first\*\***, query user table **\*\*once\*\*** to get ten users; **\*\*second\*\***,for loop users to query post table for each user at one time, orm query post table **\*\*ten\*\*** times  
\* code would be something like this:  
\`\`\`py  
users = user.query.limit(10) # query once  
for user in users:  
posts = post.query.filter\_by(user\_id==user.id)  
\# query ten times  
\# all times query table is 1 + 10  
\`\`\`  
\* if you query user table 1 time and get **\*\*n\*\*** users,then you need query post table **\*\*n\*\***  times to get posts,all times query tables are **\*\*1+n\*\***, this is called **\*\*n+1\*\*** problem(may be called 1+n more reasonable).  
\* in fact,if you are familiar with join, there is no need to query n+1 times.  
\* so in your project,**\*\*carefully\*\*** deal with this scenario.  
\* facebook provide a solution called **\*\*dataloader\*\*** to solve this.  
**## 10. the downside of rest**  
\* although rest has many advantages,it does has some disadvantages.  
\* the major downside is waste of resources, such as network io.  
\* in rest,you query a resource you get **\*\*all fields\*\*** of it. in many case,you just want a part of it.  
\* another problem is url mixed,in rest,each resource need a url,when there are many resources, managing these urls could be a difficult problem.  
\* because of all these, another framework **\*\*graphql\*\*** is invented by facebook.  
\* in **\*\*graphql\*\***, there is one url,and you write query to request the fields that you want to get. it fix rest's problem.  
\* if you want to know more about graphql, check it out **\*\*\[here\](**https://graphql.org/learn/**)\*\***.  
**## 11. improvements**  
\* in this project, some code can be abstracted as a base class. in **\*\*handlers\*\***, basically they all did crud work, with only different args and slightly different logic.  
\* if curd work has been abstracted as a base class, the code could be cleaner.  
**## 12. some tools should be mentioned**  
\* **\*\*docker\*\***,using docker to run project in different platform.  
\* **\*\*docker-compose\*\***,a tool that provides you easy way to manage docker.  
\* **\*\*makefile\*\***,auto compile tools that can save you a lot of time.  
\* **\*\*pre-commit\*\***,auto format you code before you commit,these keep your project well formatted,especially useful when work in teams.  
\* **\*\*\[travis-ci.com\](**https://travis-ci.com/**)\*\***, auto integration platform, which can run your tests automatically after you push.  
\* **\*\*\[coveralls.io\](**http://coveralls.io/**)\*\***, get test coverage report after tests has been run,for example,you can use travis-ci for ci and let it send report to coveralls.  
\* **\*\*\[codebeat.co\](**https://codebeat.co/**)\*\***, calculate the complexity of your code.  
\* **\*\*\[shields.io\](**https://shields.io/**)\*\***, provide beautiful metadata badge for your project.you can just simply put your github repository url in blank,it will automatically generate suggested badges for you.  
**## 13. a word**  
\* this project is coded in python3.8 using flask-restful framework, you can treat it as **\*\*a template to learn web-framework\*\*** or just simply a **\*\*start to use python writing web project\*\***.  
\* i try to explain the framework clearly above, but if you find any mistake or want to improve the code ,you are **\*\*welcomed to contact me at hrui835@gmail.com\*\***.

1,"i'm new to this so bear with me. i am following the 'automate the boring stuff' textbook, but it gives slightly outdated instructions on using selenium. i went to [their](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html) site and followed their instructions regarding installing the geckodriver and the selenium package. 

i'm using: selenium - v3.141.0, python - 3.8.3, and mozilla firefox - 76.0.1 (64-bit), geckodriver -v0.26.0 (added to the same folder my python scripts are, which is already in path) and i'm running this on idle in windows 10.

1,"*  amazon web services – with a vast tool set that continues to grow exponentially, amazon’s capabilities are unmatched. yet its cost structure can be confusing, and its singular focus on public cloud rather than hybrid cloud or private cloud means that interoperating with your data center isn't aws's top priority.
* microsoft azure – a close competitor to aws with an exceptionally capable cloud infrastructure. if you’re an enterprise customer, azure speaks your language – few companies have the enterprise background (and windows support) as microsoft. azure knows you still run a data center, and the azure platform works hard to interoperate with data centers; hybrid cloud is a true strength.
* google cloud – a well-funded underdog in the competition, google entered the cloud market later and doesn't have the enterprise focus that helps draw corporate customers. but its technical expertise is profound, and its industry-leading tools in deep learning and artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics are significant advantages.

1,"okay, i have to admit that after seeing some of the projects put here by some users, i feel like i'm publishing this here, but a part of me is satisfied with the work done so i took courage and here it is:

premise, i am studying python through the book (python crash course 2nd). i arrived at the chapter where we talk about data science and using csv files to create various examples of analysis, an exercise was to go to wunderground and download the csv file, but i was unable to find this file and i decided to do it differently , i know how to use python to do scraping then take data from a website and how to use pillow to work with images. so i created this program and here i leave an example of what it does, nothing special but nice:

# weather data from csv and wunderground.com

hi everyone, this program is for analyzing monthly weather data from [wunderground.com](https://www.wunderground.com/)

# start the program:

to start the program you have to open the terminal and go to the  location where the files just downloaded are located, then just write

`python main.py` 

done this if the first time you open the program you will see this 

&amp;#x200b;

in this menu you can choose whether to insert the links manually one by one or take them from a .txt file example link: [https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/gb/london/eglc/date/2020-4](https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/gb/london/eglc/date/2020-4) this is the format of the link that must be inserted into the file or manually of the terminal

after inserting the various links, the program reads them one by one and creates the various csv files

 once finished you will have to choose which folder to check to analyze the data

choosing which folder to control the program checks each csv file and  analyzes each data creating in a special folder the various files  thanks to matplot, once saved thanks to pillow you take each saved image  and inside another folder an image is saved that combines all those  created, example:

1,"hi everyone!

**the problem**

i’ve always had a hard time learning something new.

since middle school, i never thought other people experienced the same problem. but i’ve noticed on academic subs, there are often threads about the difficulty of learning in spite of many free educational contents online.

it’s weird. you have unlimited information on the web, but why can’t you find better ways to process them? surely, **the process of learning should be as equally important as the content**.

after contemplating for a while, my friends and i started to work on a **personal notes sharing website that uses mental models to help us learn faster**. it’s been more than a month since we started. we used it ourselves for school and work. it’s been quite effective and got some requests to scale into a real thing.

but before proceeding any further, we wanted to see if there’s a real interest from the community.

**what’s the theory?**

* mental model #01: the feynman technique  

   * named after the great physicist, richard feyenman.
   * he used this technique to teach himself to become an admired scientist of our time.
   * summarize information into your own words and share them to others as you’d teach them.
* personal notes &amp; collaboration  

   * what if you didn’t need to search extensively for that perfect summary that you finally understand?
   * we used the feynman technique to summarize information into our own words and shared them.
   * feedbacks given for improvements
   * a huge time saver
   * used others’ notes when needed

**solution**

* the feynman technique  

   * create succinct notes online
   * auto-summary to help condense information
   * attach an image for visual recall
   * share with others to improve the notes
* collaboration through personal notes  

   * save time by picking up others’ notes
   * group feedback loop for improvements
* other mental model tools for critical thinking  

   * ie) first principle (popularized by elon musk)
   * ie) active recall
   * ie) spaced learning
   * and more...

**looks** (sample)

\*[sample screen](https://ibb.co/rsmdgqr) for auto-summarizing information

**the system**

you would create an account for free access to all of the tools &amp; content. we’d like to provide as many mental models from the beginning, but most people aren’t used to applying mental models often.

so, you’d experience the feynman technique first. create personal notes that fit your thinking. collaborate with others for feedback to improve each others’ understanding. hence, a mind hive. there’ll also be interactive tests, advanced mental models, and more.

**nuggets**

people always say education is the problem. however, that isn’t due to a lack of great educational content. a lot of the contents are free and excellent ( ie: youtube, khan academy, wikipedia). what the world really lacks is a proper way to process them, which is what a mental model is all about.

however, it’s difficult to adopt a mental model as a normal way of thinking. so, we’re trying to make it visual (ui) and fun. on top of that, if you can easily get processed notes and summarized information that can save you time from googling and watching hours of youtube videos, that’s gravy.

**what do you think?**

we’ve been using this tool just between our friends for school and work. not going to scale unless you guys are interested.

because threads on this sub eventually disappear into an abyss, leaving no trace of our conversation, here’s a google form for emails in case you want to follow more closely.

i'm not familiar with python, so please excuse my complete lack of knowledge.  i'm just trying to bang something together and the system i'm working on is already largely python based, so, here i am.

i have a data packet being transmitted via udp.

data, addr = udpsock.recvfrom(32)  
is the actual line of python that's getting each packet.

the packet is being received, no problem.

so i've got 32 bytes of data.  this is made up of 16 signed integers.

how do i unpack these bytes into sixteeen 16 bit signed integers?

in c

char data\[32\];  
int16\_t signedvalue1;  
data, addr = udpsock.recvfrom(32);  
signedvalue1 = (data\[0\] &lt;&lt; 8 | data\[1\]);

would be the rough equivalent for those two bytes -&gt; one signed int.

i'm using this for a web api project. i want to be able to represent a swagger api, manipulated it, store it, load it, etc.  it's pretty annoying to have to essentially recreate the schema in python, so i've got something that does this now (from the tests):

    # within the swagger api class
    class info(schematic):
        __schema__ = json.schemas[""info""]

    # now we can assign this schematic as it's own object
    petstore.info = info(
         title=""swagger petstore"", version=""0.0.1"")

    # still validates
    assert petstore.validate()

    # .info is now an info instance
    assert isinstance(petstore.info, info)

    # we access it with dots because info isn't a dict, 
    # it's an info schematic
    assert petstore.info.version == ""0.0.1""

    assert isinstance(petstore.info, info)

the library takes an approach of ""converting"" incoming data, rather than merely validating it. a basic example, if the schema says that the value should be an string, but we see an int, we simply turn it into a string.

it has a lot of other features, which you can see in the docs, but i wanted to highlight this.

1," after a few days of practicing beautifulsoup4 in python, i have made a flipkart parser that takes a product to search as input and parses through all the results and stores the product name, price, rating, and url of the product in a .csv file of the same name. this repository has the python file along with sample output and images explaining the different things it parses. it is a small code, i hope to add more features to it. do comment on any other feature you would like in this. here is a sample output example photo attached.

1,"i wrote a python script that scrapes a url for information that can be used for profit.  i would like to eventually turn this into an application that users can open to view a database of this information.  i was thinking i could probably use the scraping script to upload this information to an online sql database.  then i would create another script (eventually turning it into an .exe) that would pull up the database and show the user the entries like an application, i think using tkinter.  does this sound possible to do just using python?  or would i need another language to create a good looking application?  i watched some videos using tkinter but the windows it created looked like something out of windows 95 when i am trying to create an application i can eventually sell so i would like it to be aesthetically pleasing.

&amp;#x200b;

i am not an ace at python by any means just pretty decent at making web scraping scripts.  i can easily learn new libraries by looking at documentation / stack overflow.  i am just wondering if the best way to do this is just python or possibly maybe just a website that shows the database with this information.  which will way give me the most bang for my buck time-wise?  what do you guys think?",can i do this just using python? or should i use a different method?

planning to run this data into googlemaps api to populate a series of markers, and fetch() seems the wisest way to do it. the site is pretty much functional other than this problem, the ""get"" request (""/home"") to mongodb works fine in the standard crud site. it's just this seems to be a problem.

## [0.2.61] - 22/may/2020

[pr: 0.2.6 by @hakancelik96](https://github.com/hakancelik96/unimport/pull/32)

- 💪 `--include-star-import command add` include star imports during scanning and
  refactor.

- 🌈 color_diff add it shows the difference between source and refactor better.

- 🐞 all builtins names received during the scan have been fixed. builtins names will no
  longer be offered as suggestions for star import.

- 🐞 if there is no unused import, the refactor error has been fixed.

- 💪 import skip feature has been added. leave '#unimport: skip' at the end of the line
  to skip imports with some rare cases. **for example:**

  ```python
  try:
    import django #unimport:skip
  except importerror:
    print(""install django"")
  ```

- 💪 added support for the rare case of **all**. **for example:**

  ```python
  from codeop import compile_command
  __all__ = [""compile_command""]
  ```

  thanks to this feature, we take the values ​​in the `__all__` list and see if there is
  any matching import statements. if there isn't, this import is unused import.

- 💪

# about the website

**this is my first completed website:** [www.covid19earth.live](http://www.covid19earth.live/)

i'm seeking advice / feedback, let me know what you think!

this project took me roughly two weeks of full time programming to complete, involving the following:

* programming language: **python**
* framework: **django**
* javascript libraries: **three.js**
* paas: **heroku**
* interaction with a couple of apis: **google maps (reverse geocoding), and a covid-19 data api**

# the intention

[covid-19 earth 3d ](http://www.covid19earth.live/)was created with the purpose of visualising correlations between covid-19 case data, and additional global issues including:

* global corruption
* systems of government
* current climate, and climate change
* global wealth distribution
* air pollution
* population density

our perceptions of the pandemic are generated based on reported covid-19 case data. available data sets influence important decisions at all levels of society, determining pandemic prevention strategies all across the globe.

i believe it's important to analyse the role global issues play in determining our understanding of the covid-19 virus - allowing pandemic response plans to become more intelligent, and receptive to possible distortions in referenced case data.

# programming problems

personally, i enjoy experimenting with the capabilities of three.js and webgl despite encountering various performance issues. load times for the website are reasonable, but certainly not desirable.

known issues:

* globe textures can take several moments to load
* selected data for some countries will not appear
* website is optimised for desktop over mobile",made a covid-19 3d earth data visualisation website

how to use:

`python ifsearch.py --list &lt;path&gt;`

will recursively list all file and folder names with the directory specified by ""`&lt;path&gt;`"".

`python ifsearch.py --dump &lt;path&gt;`

same as `--list`, except it will list file contents with line numbers.

`python ifsearch.py --search &lt;term&gt; &lt;path&gt;`

shows path and line number of text found somewhere in ""`&lt;path&gt;`"" that matches a search string of ""`&lt;term&gt;`"".

i maintain a crm and handle the cleaning of duplicates for a university. generally, duplicates are loaded/created when a student uses a nickname to fill out their application but their test scores or some other form is filled out with their government name. typically, i export a spreadsheet and use the ""highlight duplicate values"" function in excel. however, this is only useful for exact matches such as email or mailing addresses. if the address uses trce instead of trace or rd instead of road, etc, or if the name is abby/abigail, but the address for each name is totally different, excel won't match those together. i have basic sql knowledge, and can create a query for exact email, address, and name matches and just curious if it is even possible to match potential duplicates if there is a slight difference in either of those, or if it's possible to achieve this by learning python. i have a spreadsheet of over a million that i'm sure has at least 20,000 duplicates. i'm thinking there has to be a more efficient way than reading through the entire spreadsheet! any tips?",duplicate matching

• automate the boring stuff with python by al sweigart

• python 101 by michael driscoll

• python crash course by eric matthes

• learning python by mark lutz and david ascher

my only problem is that i can’t choose which one is the best and was wondering if any of you guys have used these books in the past. i also did a little bit of further research to find that these intermediate books were decent but with these books, i also don’t know what to choose once i finish the first one.

1,"so i'm reasonably versed in python and coding in general, but html is fairly new to me, which might be why i'm having a hard time here. my problem is that i don't know how to access very specific bits of information from a webpage. for example, i'm playing around with scraping definitions from [dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com), mainly because i figure that they have a standard layout for each word's page.

[here's my code](https://imgur.com/vfybxha), [here's a bit of the html of the webpage](https://imgur.com/j65hlcp), and [here's my error message.](https://imgur.com/uubmqqk)

i thought i could use 

    res = requests.get('...')

but it doesn't seem to be working. i've tried it with a '.' in front of the class and with a '#' in front of the class, neither of which seem to work.

1,"hi everybody. new to the sub and wanted to see if this is the right place to post this question. unsure if bot is considered a dirty word, but here we go...

the question: where should i go next with my project?

long story short, my friends got me into a mobile game. i hate mobile games, but i grew to like this one due to one thing: i made a bot for it.
i've become more engaged with the game because of the bot. 

i know i'm in cheating territory and that's not my goal. my goals are refining my skills in python, being more social with my good friends in a game they enjoy, and also to not waste precious time in farming loops (yes, cheating). and let's be real: gatcha games are not loosing money.

anyways, here's what i have working so far:
1. i use scrcpy that handles mirroring of my android phone
2 scrcpy uses adb so i can send commands easily, but i don't use this method yet,
a. what i do instead (for now) is find the android window through win32api and simulate mouse clicks
b. the scrcpy window is scanned with image recognition software (forget the name - will update later) and matches pre-snipped images of where i want it to click.

logic is simple and i want to take it to the next level: in essence i've been looking at machine learning with image processing, but not only is it complicated (and some websites are bad 
and have clickbaits). 

i have a basic understanding of preprocessors (taking sets of images, etc), but i'm lost as to where to start.

note: i like hand-holding tutorials as i always break away after reading it multiple times.

1,"hi there

i'm really struggling with something i think should be very basic. granted i'm not a senior dev or anything but even going by the docs out there this seems to be trickier than i thought!

i am learning azure functions. i have some experience writing lambdas. i am using python. my function is very simple - it's an http triggered function, which takes some data posted to it and does some manipulation. i'm just trying to figure out the flow with tooling via vscode etc.

so, i've got a webhook (from twilio) posting to this function. however, i can't seem to explore/extract/understand all the http variables in the request object! nothing i do seems to work!

i've tried the following from the boilerplate template that is produced in vscode (which doesn't work!)

`logging.info(""body:"" + str(req.params.get('body')))`

i've also tried the following (which also doesn't work)

`req_body.get('body')`

i've tried the following:

`logging.info(str(vars(req)))`

which works ok. but, i want to get to the individual vars. for the record, this is what i get from the above line

    {'_httprequest__method': 'post', '_httprequest__url': 'https://whatsappchatbot.azurewebsites.net/api/getwhatsappmessage', '_httprequest__headers': &lt;azure.functions._http.httprequestheaders object at 0x7f4839783650&gt;, '_httprequest__params': mappingproxy({}), '_httprequest__route_params': mappingproxy({}), '_httprequest__body_bytes': b'mediacontenttype0=image%2fjpeg&amp;smsmessagesid=mmd62822edbce4db10e4132c378bbecee1&amp;nummedia=1&amp;smssid=mmd62822edbce4db10e4132c378bbecee1&amp;smsstatus=received&amp;body=&amp;to=whatsapp%3a%2b14155238886&amp;numsegments=1&amp;messagesid=mmd62822edbce4db10e4132c378bbecee1&amp;accountsid=acc79910c195bd6fe6d3a99e4609502ee3&amp;from=whatsapp%3a%2b447778970173&amp;mediaurl0=https%3a%2f%2fapi.twilio.com%2furlstuff&amp;apiversion=2010-04-01', '_httprequest__form_parsed': false, '_httprequest__form': none, '_httprequest__files': none, '_httprequest__body_type': 'bytes', '_httprequest__body_str': none}

1,"my university started working on a ‘track and trace’ application for the current pandemic, similar to that which the nhs is developing currently in the uk, however the university hasn’t been overwhelmed with responses which lead to me thinking about how one would collect a group of formidable minds, to undertake such a task. 

so i turned my attention to here, and have decided to make this post. 

excuse me if this is taken as idealistic naivety, as without the support of admins, and no foundation set already, it may seem to be an impossible task to organise everyone and allow for quality contribution, but, we are all here on this sub out of a love/interest/desire to learn more about python and its application to real world scenarios, we are also all affected by this current virus, and sadly many of us will have lost friends, and/or loved ones. that, in conjunction with the unquestionably great amounts of knowledge that many people here have on the language, provides us with both the perfect motivation, and vessel to undertake such a project. what greater opportunity to firstly use our skills for the benefit of society, and to also have a very unique, and efficient way to learn under real life scenarios and circumstances. reddit provides us with a great area to communicate and contribute, and the resources available to us collectively, provide the perfect means. this wouldn’t be a profit driven enterprise, nor would it necessarily have to be akin to the track and trace; there’s many different applications that could be useful, provided free of charge to the public, even something as simple as a ‘news’ application which provides un-opinionated, purely factual information about how different countries are moving forward, and where we stand globally. 
i’m interested to hear everyone’s thoughts, and as a finality i feel it’s important for me to highlight that i’d have no intention of managing the project myself, my experience of python pales in comparison to many of you, and my experience in team management doesn’t exist at all! my initial thoughts would be that perhaps the admin team would like to take lead (if they’re up to it of course)

2. it doesn't matter if you use a character, then a special character, then the ../../../../, it will still read the path.
3. no matter how much garbage you add to the beginning of the path, it will still read the ../../../../ without a problem.

\[a little while ago\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/gfru6b/major\_update\_to\_a\_python\_bytecode\_interpreter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/comments/gfru6b/major_update_to_a_python_bytecode_interpreter/))  i mentioned a revamp of this python 3.3 interpreter (which was a revamp of an older python 2.x interpreter).

well, i was pouring over x-python's trace log to find and fix the numerous bugs in this program. i was finding it tedious.

i am not the only one. for example in [https://github.com/nedbat/byterun/issues/29#issuecomment-361549144](https://github.com/nedbat/byterun/issues/29#issuecomment-361549144)

\&gt; the byte code changes are easily fixable (in the branch above), but adding new opcodes is taking time.

and then i realized - hey, i've written a debugger already for python that could help me debug this interpeter as it interprets bytecode. and so it has!

the interaction between this and \`x-python\` is pretty cool, and the possibilities for which direction to go in on both projects are numerous and vast.

so here it is.  i can die now and my life is complete.

commands like \`next\`, \`finish\` and breakpoints, aren't there yet. but rather than sit on it this, i thought i'd release. this is very usuable as is and has helped me understand what's going under the hood. so, release early and often!

here is one of the many aspects that i like and is different about this. you can read and find various tutorials on python bytecode, many with nicely drawn diagrams showing the execution of a particular example. the problem is the these age very quickly \&amp;mdash; when the next release of python comes along the bytecode changes.

the material may address some specifics of how things work, but it might not address \_your\_ specific questions, or specific sequences of code you might be interested in (without a lot of work). 

well, with this interpreter and debugger you now can see what's up, both then and now. and you might not even need to have pyton version x installed to be able to run version x bytecode. so maybe you can go that tutorial or talk and run the code as it was then, then see it as it is now (which may or may not be the same).

before finishing, i would like mention pypy and its bytecode interpreter. it is much more complete, larger, and generally well thought out. as you might expect, these guys really know python and know how to write it! however, the pypy bytecode interpreter isn't right now separable from the rest - a jit. and it makes sense given that pypy's mission is for making a faster python, not experimenting with or as a teaching tool for python bytecode.",python bytecode debugger

1,"hey guys.

like many people here (maybe not), i’ve had issues when it comes to learning something new and understanding knowledge to heart ❤️

so, last year, i started a journey of trying out diverse learning techniques and applied them to grasp programming, physics, and some european history 🕍

some of these techniques were...

[the feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)

[active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/active_recall)

the first problem i faced was a lack of **guidance**. youtube videos and mentors told me what to do (how to think), but there wasn’t a useful tool for it. thinking on a blank sheet of paper was difficult and not very scalable.

the second problem was that even if i had followed the methods, it was tough to share the results, get feedback, and improve.

lastly, it was a pain in the ass to search for summaries of new concepts that were personalized to my level of understanding. just googling took longer than the whole learning process. to make the matters worse, youtube videos that are supposed to be helpful were full of fluff that i didn’t need.

e.g.) “hey, welcome to my channel! before we get into the main topic…”

i just wanted to understand a concept quickly. not read or listen to 20 minutes of their life. at this point, the frustration was out of hand.

this experiment highlighted the importance of summarization, sharing (teaching someone), and connecting to a deep network of collaborators (self-learners).

after contemplating, my friends and i decided to just build a tool. we knew plenty of professionals that were self-taught in their field as well as fellow struggling students. it was easy to start testing.

the students loved it more than the “adults”. they had more use for it (obviously). we also saw those two demographics creating personal notes, collaborating, and teaching each other. it wasn't a one-time thing. they kept “coming back” to the app, and improved (iterated) their knowledge and understanding.

we got a lot of feedback. i even asked other subreddits if they wanted to see this tool evolve into a real service. that's how we decided to scale it into a real thing, starting with a **private launch**.

about **300 people** asked to join the private launch and we’re happy to say that the **private version** is almost done 💪

&amp;#x200b;

**the learning theory (private launch) 📖**

* mental model #01: the feynman technique
   * named after the great physicist, richard feynman.
   * using this technique, he became an admired scientist of our time.
   * summarize information into your own words and share &amp; teach others.
* personalized knowledge
   * no need to search extensively for that perfect summary that you finally get.
   * everyone understand in different ways
* collaboration
   * share &amp; teach each other
   * exchange feedbacks for improvement

&amp;#x200b;

**features (private launch) ⚡️**

* the feynman technique
   * auto-summary to help condense information
   * attach image for greater recall
   * create succinct notes
   * share with others
* personal notes
   * find personal notes **easier to understand than yours**

&amp;#x200b;

**next up 🏍**

* collaborative sharing &amp; teaching (social learning)
* active recall
   * dynamic quizzes per subjects
   * create and take tests with friends

1,"i'm looking to learn a new programming language that works well together with python, filling in its holes and integrating well.

however, i've found it very difficult to actually find the best language to learn which would both *complement and work well with* python and also *not do the same thing (*e.g. general-purpose higher-level language). i've gotten suggestions ranging from rust to c++ to java to cython and would like to finally figure out which is recommended and the industry standard.

i'm hoping that through this poll other reddit users and i can gain an insight into which language it would be best to learn to expand ones programming skills and extend python functionality.

if you have any experience working with languages that integrate with python, please share in the comments below as well, so that we can see reasons why they would be a good idea to use.

i'm going to write a small web application with possible api endpoints using python. it won't have much traffic, will be used by employees of the organization. i don't have expertise in python but in other languages. as client wants to write the application using python, now i'm confused to choose the framework. i prefer something for faster development. the backend will be either oracle or sql server. now seeking advices from python expert on the following things - 

* which framework i should choose?
* which backend i should prefer as i've option to choose from oracle vs mssql(probably it doesnt matter as framework might comes with orm)?
* any short course (few hours) link to catchup python?

appreciate any response.

i might pitch my  employer the idea to re-build their erp system (currently using sap) tailored to their needs. the company produces large goods (max. production capacity of 2400 units) and they use their system for new orders, keeping track of orders, and invoicing. no need to process millions of orders every second. 

due to lack of investing in their erp system and the high prices of sap, their system is **bad** and not suited. example: to enter an order, they receive it as email, print it out and have to enter it manually into the erp. they expressed several times to wish to replace it and i am currently learning django (switched from flask) and the *batteries* are awesome and i thought, why not?

1,"python is a general-purpose programming language. we can use python for so many applications and including web applications. framework is a collection of modules or packages, which helps in writing a web application or helps in developing a web application. we don't have to worry about low level details such as protocols, socket, thread management when working with a framework.

framework makes the developer’s life smarter and easier by giving a structure for application development. they automate the implementation of common solutions, which gives flexibility to developers to focus only on app logic instead of routine. they provide common backend fast reliable and scalable easily maintainable web applications.

frameworks provides functionality to perform the following operations for developing web applications.

* url routing.
* input form handling and validation.
* output formats with templating engine html, xml, json.
* data connection, manipulating using orm mappers.
* web security.
* session storage and retrieval.

## url routing

mechanism of url mapping is staying at the same web page when you click on some other link.

## input form handling and validation

the data entered into a form needs to be in the right format, and certain fields are mandatory for effective use of form.

## output formats with templating engine

allows developers to design the content of their own type.

## data connection, manipulating using omr

* persistent data manipulation.
* object relational mapper - it is a code library that automates the transfer of data into a relational database table into objects that are most commonly used in an application.

## web security

web security against the cross site required forgery also known as a csrf sql injection cross-site scripting and other common malicious attacks.

## session storage

they are only few operations we can perform using python frameworks.

## advantages of python frameworks:

* open source - no need of spending money.
* good documentation - learn any functionality &amp; key features.
* security - secured against malicious attacks.
* integrations and efficiency.

## disadvantages

open source code is going to be public, library and framework we have different rules and regulations.

## why python frameworks?

* easier implementation
* maintenance
* code reusability
* readability

## django

many people who try to build a web application in python will opt for django framework so that they can build a complex code in less time with best quality. django change it’s functionality comparatively according to the trends in the web development. few key features of django are:

* open source.
* full stack framework.
* authentication.
* url routing.
* template engine.
* dry ( don’t repeat yourself).
* orm mappers.
* database schema migrations ,common database like postgresql, mysql , sqlite, oracle under the third party drivers.
* follow mvc architecture.

## pyramid

pyramid is a part of pylon project; it is one of the most flexible frameworks in python language. this framework allows the developer to choose anything - dbms, url structure, template styles and much more.

* flexible and adaptable.
* simple structure and easy to learn.
* transparency and measured quality.
* security management.
* flexible tools for authentication and authorization script.
* template languages and engines including jinja2 and mako.
* traversal framework for mapping urls to code.
* http caching.
* built-in support for session storage.
* create traditional routes-oriented rdbms applications.

## web2py

web2py is an open source and free of cost. it allows debugger and code editor for editing the code and debugging the code accompanied with a deployment tool. it enables developers to develop, revise, deploy and manage web applications via web browsers.

* open source.
* full stack framework.
* own web based.
* code editor, debugger, one-click deployment.
* error tracking and ticketing system(ticketing framework).
* follows mvc architecture.
* data security.
* role-based access control.
* backward compatibility.
* no need of instillation.
* no multiple protocols.

## flask

the main motive for introducing flask is to build a strong web application. flask is being used by all big companies as it fast and secure.

* a micro framework.
* lightweight - has a modular design which makes it easy to developer needs.
* it includes number of out of the box features.
* built-in development server.
* fast debugger.
* restful request dispatching.
* supports jinja2 templating.
* modern day templating language made after django template language.
* unicode based - secured cookie support that is client side sessions.
* wsgi compliance - web server gateway interface.
* unicode - ability to plug in any orm.
* http request handling.

## bottle

it is popularly known as small-scale microframe works. it mainly focuses on web api’s and it tries to bundle everything in a single document. it has no dependencies apart from the python standard library.

* microframework.
* single source file originally it was meant for building apis, which means everything in a single source file.
* url routing.
* templating engine.
* utilities.
* abstraction over wsgi standard.
* prototyping, building simple personal applications.
* perfect for prototyping, learning the organization of web frameworks and building simple personal applications.

## cherrypy

cherrypy is a popular framework that embeds its very own multi-strung server. cherrypy includes a pooled web server, set up framework and module framework.

* open source minimalist approach.
* object oriented with a minimalist approach.
* http wsgi compliant thread pooled web server.
* running multiple http servers at once.
* powerful configuration.
* flexible plug in system.
* tools for caching, encoding,sessions, authentication and static content.
* built-in support for profiling ,coverage, and testing.
* ability to run on different platforms.

there are many python frameworks evolving every year with new features and functionality despite of their pros and cons. developers use many frameworks depending on their task because every developer has different style of coding and preferences.

by far, the most popular framework according to the trends is django because the count of enterprises using django is pretty high. django features and characteristics are similar to the business requirements of many industries that might be the reason behind it’s popularity. find more information [why should choose django for your next project](https://micropyramid.com/blog/which-is-the-best-python-framework-for-web-development/)

pyramid is flexible to use for small to enterprise level companies. the only conflict in pyramid is that it has many options, which creates a havoc before starting the project. flask is commonly used by developer’s because it is mostly commonly used for small industries with jet speed. the suitable framework will always suit your business needs. you have to consider the main agenda of your application, budget, time and then decide the framework type to start your application.

i did something many people will really appreciate. as many of you know in javascript there's a feature that allows you to access dictionary values like members of classes.

so i implemented this feature into python.

you can download the script with the class from [here](https://max-weiser.de/static/code/json_upgrade.py).

the program is a simple calculator for calculating the values of a resistor based on the color of the bands, and i can't figure out why it says i need a string value despite the fact that ints should work just fine. if anyone would be brave enough to help this poor soul out it'd be greatly appreciated!

1,"hi all!

i'm not sure whether this is a strictly a python question, so feel free to remove it if it violates the guidelines.

i'm making a python program to automate joining online lectures for attendance (windows for now but might port it to mac later). the overly generalized flow of the program is as follows:

1. login to the learning platform website and get links for adobe connect sessions (adobe connect is an online videoconferencing platform which has a desktop client).
2. at appropriate times, launch adobe connect using the obtained links.

i’m done with the first step, but i’m having problems with automating the second part. from the research that i’ve done, adobe connect doesn’t have an api for the client side, neither does it have a command-line interface (but please do correct me if i’m wrong). this leaves me with two options, but each of them has problems that i can’t solve.

**option 1: browser automation using selenium.**

normally, when a user clicks the “join” link from their browser, it redirects them to the adobe connect website. from there, the user can either run connect in browser using flash (which i'm trying to avoid at all costs), or they can launch connect from their browser directly. judging by my very surface knowledge of browser internals, this happens, because the user is redirected to a link that starts with “connectpro:” which is the protocol for adobe connect. the browser then finds a locally installed program, which can handle the protocol and prompts the user whether they want to open connect.

however, the prompt to open an external program from within chrome is not showing up in selenium ide recording. i think this is due to the prompt not being an alert window (such as one that you get by calling “alert()” in javascript), but a chrome subprocess. i don’t know how to confirm this dialogue in any other way. how do i overcome this without resorting to gui automation?

**option 2: autopy gui automation.**

this option seems to be more straightforward. when we open connect, we insert the link in the appropriate textbox and click “continue”.

we then enter the user login info (which is known to us, because it’s the same as learning platform info) and click “enter room”.

the biggest pitfall of this approach is that the screen resolutions and exact element positions are impossible to predict for different computers. also, i don’t know how to confirm whether connect finished loading before entering user’s login info. putting “time.sleep(5)” seems like a horrible idea. is there any library that i’m not aware of that can do this for me?

1,"hey, so mind you i'm a newbie(i think) when it comes to python and programming in general.

so i'm running about a dozen bots and scripts now from my computer(which i plan to move to a dedicated server in the future), that have a different purpose - from reddit and twitter bots to bots that manage my social media needs, selenium testing scripts, and others.

now when i had 2 or 3 scripts running, it was quite easy to go through my logs and check everything, ya know - sometimes things go wrong - i might've goofed some test or didn't think about something else, or something changes with the websites my scripts are working. once in a while, the whole script will fail because of a bug.

should i monitor my logs with another script and email myself when something goes wrong? should i create a 'mother' script that monitors other scripts if they fail, etc.? what is the pythonic way to handle this? are there already libraries/applications made do handle these problems? i'm not sure what to search for in google. 

thanks!",how do you manage your scripts/bots in regard to error handling/logs notifications?

1,"i'm building a bot that plays games like secret hitler or mafia in discord, and it's be difficult since the discord library is more purpose built for moderation and stuff like that. it also seems to force the use of global variables for my use purposes far more than what to me seems to be necessary. 

my code for these two functions:
https://textbin.net/pqdtvaw5sy

the reason all the code is inside each if clause, rather than more sensibly in one formatted string at the end, is that in that function, logic just isn't working in a way that makes sense to me. 

i previously tried using one line at the end to output the text but it never worked, it's like the function just stops inside those if clauses and the bot stops responding to all other commands, but it hasn't actually crashed.

0,"hello everyone! i'm trying to learn go, and to do so i've created a little quiz game to study psychopathology for an exam. my problem is that i don't like the code i've wrote, so i'm trying to do better, hoping to learn good go practices this way. 

my question is: if i have a nested struct, with maps and stuff like this:

```go
type disorders struct {
    disorders []disorder
}

type disorder struct {
    name     string
    symptoms symptom
    // more stuff
}

type symptom struct {
    cognitive map[string]string
    emotional map[string]string
    // more stuff
}
```

there's a bunch of more fields, and i want to create a ```.string()``` method for everyone of them, that lets me specify the kind of symptom, the key of the map, etc.

i plan to use grpc as an inter-service sync communication protocol. there are lots of different services and i have generated a pb.go  
 file with all the relevant code for client and server using protoc  
 with the go-rpc plugin.

now i'm trying to figure out the best way or the common way of consuming this service from another service. here is what i have so far:

**option 1**

1. use the .proto  
 file from the service (download it)
2. run the protoc  
 compiler and generate the ...pb.go  
 file for the consumer to use

**option 2**

1. because the ...pb.go  
 is already generated on the grpc service side to implement the server and my client is another service written in go i can expose this as a sub module (another .mod  
 file in a sub- directory)
2. use go get github.com/usr/my-cool-grpc-service/client

option 2 seems more appealing to me because it makes the consumption of a service very easy and available for all other services that may require it.

on the other hand i know that the .proto  
 file is the contract that cann generate clients for many different languages and should be used the the source of truth.

i fear that by choosing option 2 i'm unaware of any possible pitfalls i might encounter with regards to backwards compatibility or any other topic..

i chose this function because it's kind of simple so it's a good example, but sometimes i have like 5 checks before the function actually does something.

in those cases, i extract the checks to another function, and end up with something like this:

in my organization we have two types of services, public facing, and internal services. our public facing apis are consumed by web clients / apps, mobile apps, etc. our internal services are consumed by our public services as well as other internal systems. our public facing services will probably remain rest apis consuming and producing json for the foreseeable future. we have no need to leverage grpc or any other transport for our public facing services. however there is interest in leveraging grpc for internal communication between public services and internal servers, and internal to internal services. if i am understanding the go-micro model correctly our internal services would be srv (service) type templates in micro and our public facing services would be using api type template. in front of the api layer we would have an api gateway.

i was trying to play around be creating a sample go-micro api application but there appears to be a bug that makes that problematic - [https://github.com/micro/go-micro/issues/1300](https://github.com/micro/go-micro/issues/1300). 

another thing i noticed was the go-micro api request only seemed to support get and post, although i could have missed it. this seems like a major limitation for those who need to support restful api that make use of the other http methods. 

are there any good resources for learning go-micro?

0,"hey all,   


i learnt go this year and got an internship in go in a company i really like (used to). the first month was really cool i got to work on some storage services. i really enjoyed go simplicity and design philosophy. the testing tool helped raising my attention to some cases i missed... even there was a code review by a junior engineer, it was not really thorough. just few minor suggestions about style and naming... actually, one commit had some package had three exported functions that are not concurrently safe and they were being used by different go routines, but got approved...   


anyway, two weeks ago i started working on the big project and i have not made a single commit since. this project is a migration from a previously written awfully slow js version. so basically they are migrating to go for performance. i was asked to implement a feature which is not very complicated to, but committing it to the current code base is. this code base is everything that can be wrong with engineering:   


* insanely poor error handling; the project would crash and you had to follow the stack trace to see what's going wrong and most likely it is not something you are working on. 
* no tests of any kind. 
* confusing comments, one file has the same comments as another file for everything single method... different behavior, different implementations. although, this is on the main branch and went through code review? 
* mutex everywhere even when the method is concurrently safe. once i raised the lock contention issue we have in the code base and the manager said ""we got no time for that now.""  
* 0 [readme.md](https://readme.md) files.

  
so today i tried my best to go through the code base, i gave it solid 4 hours then i gave up. the straw that broke the camel's back was the abuse of interface{}. every method is returning an empty interface. i saw that in every meeting someone says we need to refactor most of the team says we will do it after we are done. thus, i am stuck working on this nightmare for the three next months. this week i have started working solely on side projects and preparing the interviewing process to get into reputable tech companies. i hate my job. i cannot complain about the company on any level but the product itself.   


as resigning is not an option, how can i convince them to start doing things the right way?

in the app i am currently working on, someone wrote a code that should do something (in this case, printing ""tick!"") every, let's say 5 minutes:

    go func() {
        for {
            fmt.println(""tick!"")
            time.sleep(5 * time.minute)
        }
    }()

however, from what i have read, the recommended approach is:

    func calltickerinbackground(done &lt;-chan bool) {
        ticker := time.newticker(5 * time.minute)
        go func() {
            for {

the advantages of the latter are that we have more stable time intervals (instead of processing time + waiting time) and we have control over stopping the background processing. on the other hand, right now a separate channel to stop it needs to be created, so it's slightly more complex.

i am using this package: [https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n)

ideally i would want to do something like `locale.t(""messageid"", count, template)` in my handlers to translate messages, but how can i do this depending on the accept language headers. can i even use a package level function that way.

i posted a code sample in a gist because of syntax highlighting and formatting.

[https://gist.github.com/dankobgd/27dccf72771407469a6f9ff95d207d57](https://gist.github.com/dankobgd/27dccf72771407469a6f9ff95d207d57)

i create these localizers (they translate messages) when my app starts and store them in a map, and idea is to fetch them from the map based on the accept lang value on each request.

i know i can write something like this in every handler:

    func (a *api) test(w http.responsewriter, r *http.request) {
    	t := locale.tfuncwithlanguage(""en"")
    	msg := locale.t(""hello"", nil, nil)
    	msg2 := t(""hello"", nil, nil)
    	respondjson(w, http.statusok, map[string]string{""msg"": msg, ""msg2"": msg2})
    }

but i don't want to call this `tfuncwithlanguage` every time to get the `t` function, what options do i have?

basically now `locale.t` is initialized with ""en"" language when my server starts, how do i make it dynamic.

0,"hey gophers!

a few months back i had a need for a commandline spinner, to provide some useful feedback for a tool i was writing. i tried to use the most popular spinner that we have in our ecosystem and i ran in to a few challenges. i initially thought about enhancing that package, but it would have required substantial breaking changes.

that ultimately took me down the path of writing my own, to experiment with a new api and implementation. i haven't had many ideas on what to add in the past few months, and am happy with the result so far, so i thought it might be good to share with you:

- https://github.com/theckman/yacspin

there are a few major differences from the other spinners we have in our ecosystem:

* it's safe for concurrent use (updating content while spinner is running)
* the ability to update the text in the spinner isn't tied to the animation
  * this means you don't need to trade animation aesthetics to have live-updating info
* success and failure results, that can use different final characters and message colors
* the spinner dynamically indents any text you specify to the maximum animation size
  * that way any text in your spinner doesn't shift back and forth as the spinner animates
* the ability to pause the animation so you can update a few properties at once, and make them appear atomic to the user

i've detailed quite a few of these in the `readme.md` file, and even have gifs that compare the behaviors to other spinners if you're interested.

this seems to work as expected on mac, linux, and windows. if you run in to any issues, or have any ideas for additions or changes, [please raise an issue](https://github.com/theckman/yacspin/issues/new)! likewise, happy to review and accept contributions you raise.

i hope some of you find this useful, and are staying safe out there.

cheers!",yet another cli spinner for go: yacspin
0,"i see this anti-pattern everywhere. somebody wants to keep track of whether values have been seen or not, so they do something like this:

    seen := make(map[string]struct{})
    ...
    seen[key] = struct{}{}
    ...
    if _, ok := seen[otherkey]; ok {
        ...
    }

don't do this. just use a map with bool values instead. now your code becomes:

    seen := make(map[string]bool)
    ...
    seen[key] = true
    ...
    if seen[otherkey] {
        ...
    }

no need to use the existence check in the map or the weird anonymous empty struct initializer. it's cleaner and more obvious to readers. if you're using struct{} values in your existence check map because you've seen other people do it, just stop. it's pointless cargo-cult behavior, unless you actually, really have a very large map and need to save every possible byte. you probably don't.

0,"i am migrating an xml importer tool from php to go

the xml files that i have to parse are very loosely defined, both in terms of parent depth and in element naming.

the common ground is that i have a parent element 2 or 3 levels from the top, and then child elements that i want to get into an array/slice

element name mapping is provided from configuration for each xml during runtime

for example one xml file can be something like

element naming mapping:
id: myid
title: mytitle
parent: parent
child: mychild

``` xml
&lt;root&gt;
    &lt;first&gt;
        &lt;parent&gt;
            &lt;mychild&gt;
                &lt;myid&gt;
                    123
                &lt;/myid&gt;
                &lt;mytitle&gt;
                    title goes here
                &lt;/mytitle&gt;
            &lt;/mychild&gt;
            &lt;mychild&gt;
                &lt;myid&gt;
                    124
                &lt;/myid&gt;
                &lt;mytitle&gt;
                    second title goes here
                &lt;/mytitle&gt;
            &lt;/mychild&gt;
        &lt;/parent&gt;
    &lt;/first&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
```

and the second could be something like

element naming mapping:
id: myalternateid
title: myalternatetitle
parent: alternateparent
child: alternatechild

``` xml
&lt;alternateroot&gt;
    &lt;alternatefirst&gt;
        &lt;alternatesecond&gt;
            &lt;alternateparent&gt;

                    &lt;myalternateid&gt;
                        123
                    &lt;/myalternateid&gt;
                    &lt;myalternatetitle&gt;
                        title goes here
                    &lt;/myalternatetitle&gt;
                &lt;/alternatechild&gt;
                &lt;alternatechild&gt;
                    &lt;myalternateid&gt;
                        124
                    &lt;/myalternateid&gt;
                    &lt;myalternatetitle&gt;
                        second title goes here
                    &lt;/myalternatetitle&gt;
                &lt;/alternatechild&gt;

0,"i was looking through gmail a few days back and realized that i had created so many filters for my many different labels. most of them had a really common criteria: from &lt;email&gt;, archive it, then add a given label. 

i had nearly 20 filters created just to add a set of different emails to a label for my school work - and that was just for one label. i dreaded the thought of trying to manage and sort through them manually. so, in programmer fashion, i decided to hack together a quick and simple cli tool that would authenticate a gmail account and then proceed to clean up the filters list.

essentially, the tool will look through all the available filters, find the ones that match the criteria outlined above, and then re-organize the filters by deleting all of them and creating a single large filter to assign a set of emails to a given label. 

i tested it out on my own email account and managed to reduce the number of filters from 172 to 63!

quick, off the top of your head: what html nodes will the following produce?`html.parse(strings.newreader(""&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr"")`if (like me!) you thought

my question is for the backend language. i had been looking at node.js, or django, however two factors have me considering go. i had planned to learn python as my primary programming language, so it seemed natural to look into django. but for one thing, it seems learning django is like learning a little bit of a different language on top of python. same for node.js. i've also become interested in go from a future looking standpoint. i've been leaning toward learning go as my first and primary programming language.

my question is purely on the backend aspect. from the articles i've been looking at, you can just call the net/http (or other web) package to use? i am still learning, but on the surface this seems a whole lot easier to use go as a backend framework than learning node.js on top of js or django on top of python.

i am currently following this simple approach to create a byte array from a struct with:

this works perfectly until my struct holds an embedded struct with a pointer, for example:

        type testembeddedpointerstruct struct {

in my tests this creates a different byte array each time, i think it may be because with the pointer the address in memory changes each time?

0,"in the old days, it was quite common to use xml (and then later json) configuration for various environments. i found an example loading json for config data as well. that is what i am doing now. but as i know these sorts of things will be in docker containers and eventually deploy to the cloud... would it make more sense to embrace the use of env vars for all configuration, and remove the need to load various .json files for different environments? 

how common is it to specify say, a dozen or more config values via env variables per service (obviously each service has a varying number of config properties).

trying to move some code around into a ""shared"" repo that my other repos can import and use/reuse. as such, i have a github repo under my company, called helper. so i currently set the go mod init to [github.com/company/helper](https://github.com/company/helper).  import then is ""[github.com/company/helper](https://github.com/company/helper)"".

i am wondering though.. do i have to add [github.com](https://github.com) just because it's hosted there? i assume that it is required to let go know to find the code there, yah? or is there some other way to configure my import/mod name to just by company/helper and then configure that company/helper is found at [github.com/company/helper](https://github.com/company/helper)?

0,"hey all,

i'm fairly new to golang, and i'm writing my first package. what i'm trying to do is wrap the xdotool linux extension for use in go code. obviously, since this is a command line tool, this requires use of command line execution. as far as i can tell, os/exec is the one-stop shop for this. 

until it isn't. 

here's the problem. the syntax for xdotool is as follows:

`xdotool &lt;command&gt; &lt;options&gt; &lt;args&gt;`
`xdotool keydown --delay 100 shift`

here's the issue:

```
args1 := []string{key, --delay 100, a, b} //these args don't work
args2 := []string{key, a, b) //this does work, types ""a"", ""b""

exec.command(""xdotool, args&lt;num&gt;...).run()
```

any command containing options (--delay, --clearmodifiers, etc.) does not work, while any command with no modifiers functions exactly as expected.

0,"i've been working with go for a bit now, but this is my first time creating a rest api. i found that i had a lot of repetition when it came to returning json error responses (i know that error handling in go can be repetitive, which i generally like coming from the python world). 

let's say my method validates the request, and then does a few database queries, does a computation, and then some other work, all of which can fail.

i register my routes like

    srv.r.handlefunc(""/api/foo/"", srv.getfoo).methods(""get"")

and then i created a helper function to reduce the amount of repetition. this helped clean up my code a bit.

    func createerror(w http.responsewriter, code int, msg string) {
    	w.writeheader(code)
    	json.newencoder(w).encode(myerror{msg: msg})
    }
    
    type myerror struct {
    	msg string `json:""msg""`
    }
    

and then one of the methods might look something like 

    func (srv *server) getfoo(w http.responsewriter, r *http.request) {
    	w.header().set(""content-type"", ""application/json"")
    	req := foo{fooid: r.header.get(""foo_id"")}
    	_, err := govalidator.validatestruct(&amp;req)
    	if err != nil {
    		// log error
    		createerror(w, http.statusbadrequest, err.error())
    		return
    	}
            ...
            fooinfo, err := srv.getfoodetailsfromdb(req)
            if err != nil {
                createerror(w, http.statusinternalservererror, ""unexpected error"")
                return
            }
            
            foovalue, err := srv.calculatefoovalue(fooinfo)
            if err != nil {
                createerror(w, http.statusinternalservererror, ""unexpected error"")
                return
            }
            // etc etc
            response, err := srv.generatefooresponse(foovalue, fooinfo)
            if err != nil {
                createerror(w, http.statusinternalservererror, ""unexpected error"")
                return
            }
            json.newencoder(w).encode(response)
    }

is there a better way to do this? i find it isn't as bad with my \`createerror\` function, but it still feels a bit clunky.

i suppose i could combine all of my methods into something like \`doworkforfoo()\`, and then call all of these methods from there, passing the appropriate http status code to \`createerror\` if any of those fail. but it still results in the same amount of repetition.

alternatively, i could return one error from \`doworkforfoo()\`, and then check what the error is, and set the appropriate status code/message there.

any thoughts/ideas would be greatly appreciated!",avoiding repetition in a rest api?
0,"a massive shout out to sacado2 on hackernews

 imagine we're working together and i have some text document i want you to work on and update. if i send you the text by email, i send a *copy* of it (the original text is still on my computer). if you modify that copy and keep it for you, i won't ever know what you did. i just used a function

       func (c coworker) sendforupdates(d document) {         ...     } 

that wouldn't make sense. you worked hard and i don't even know what you did. so, what i would expect you to do is, once you made updates on the copy, to send me back that copy by email. that would be akin to

       func (c coworker) sendforupdates(d document) document {         ...         return d     } 

i sent you a copy, and you returned another updated copy. that is ""pass-by-value"", the default, no-pointer style.

now, let's say i think those emails back and forth and boring. rather than sending you a copy of the text each time, i could rather use google docs, and send you the *link* to that document. its url, rather than a copy of its content. now, you can just go to that url and do the updates on the document. you don't have to send me back the document: you're working on it, not on a copy of it! well, that url is a reference to the document rather than the document itself, or, if you prefer, a *pointer* to it. so, now, the function would be

       func (c coworker) sendforupdates(d *document) {         ...     } 

and we're done, no more back-and-forth dance now! that is ""pass-by-reference"".

you don't only use ""pass-by-reference"" just to be able to check updates on the document sent, by the way. if i want to send you some text just for your information and i don't expect any kind of update, i'll use pass-by-value (the very first function). but what if i want to send you a 3 gb video? i can't send that through e-mail! sending a copy would be totally inefficient. once again, i'll send you a pointer, an url to download the video:

       func (c coworker) informtext(d document) // d is small: pass-by-value      func (c coworker) informbigvideo(v *video) // videos are huge: pass-by-reference 

why not use pointers everywhere by default, they seem easier, right? that's basically what java and python do. well, they can be tricky too. i gave you the url to the link and you could work on it. once you're done, i don't want you to modify the document anymore. i want to send it to our boss. but, how could i know you didn't keep the url somewhere in your bookmarks? how do i know, of all the coworkers i sent the url to, one of them doesn't keep on updating that document even when i don't want to anymore? with copies, i'm safe, do whatever the hell you want with your copy, i don't care anymore. but a reference to the original document? that can be dangerous.

i'm relatively new to saml. i am using gosaml2, which seems to be the easiest to use and understand. 

i have basic http-redirect working just fine, but i wanted to use traefik's forwardauth facility. i thought about using http-post instead to send a post form to the idp (using keycloak at home to test), and hopefully getting a response back. then using a 2xx series answer, send the result for traefik to proxy or auth. 

at the moment, when i do a post, i get a ""saml\_token\_not\_found"" in the idp events (invalid request).

any idea if this can be done using post? i would use the redirect method, except i don't know how to capture the response back from the idp in the same request. ""vouch"" seems to be able to do this for oauth, which i believe also does a redirect, but i am not sure. i will look at this source again to see what's going on.

0,"i am new to golang and i have a task that i have implemented using `waitgroup`, and `mutex` which i would like to convert to use `channels` instead.

a very brief description of the task is this: spurn as many go routines as needed to processes a result and in the main go routine wait and collect all the results.

the implementation i have using `waitgrou`p, and `mutex` is as follows:

```
package main

import (
    ""fmt""
    ""math/rand""
    ""sync""
    ""time""
)

func process(input int, wg *sync.waitgroup, result *[]int, lock *sync.mutex) *[]int {
    defer wg.done()
    defer lock.unlock()

    rand.seed(time.now().unixnano())
    n := rand.intn(5)
    time.sleep(time.duration(n) * time.second)
    lock.lock()
    *result = append(*result, input * 10)

    return result
}

func main() {

    var wg sync.waitgroup
    var result []int
    var lock sync.mutex
    for i := range []int{1,2,3,4,5} {
        wg.add(1)
        go process(i, &amp;wg, &amp;result, &amp;lock)
    }
}

```

how do i replace the memory synchronization with the usage of `mutex` to one that uses `channels`?

my main problem is i am not sure how to determine the final go routine that is processing the final task and hence have that one be the one to close the `channel`. the idea is that by closing the `channel` the main go routine can loop over the `channel`, retrieve the results and when it sees the `channel` has been closed, it moves on.

it could also be that the approach to close the `channel` is the wrong one in this scenario, hence why i am asking here.

0,"i'm thinking of how to develop a high performance backtesting program that would test potentially billions of trading strategies against historical stock option data. i'm planning on loading all of the historical stock option data in memory, since any kind of disk lookup is going to be prohibitively expensive. 

so my question is, what is better for performance: loading all the data into arrays of pointers to structs; or loading the data into 2d arrays of floats? 

the values i'm loading are things like stock price, bid, ask, volume, etc. all can be represented as floats. if using a 2d array, i would create variables like ""high = 0"", ""low = 1"", and then i'd reference the array index with those variables. 

i'm assuming the arrays would be better performance wise, since all data could be allocated continuously in memory. i'm assuming pointers to structs would involve some lookup on the heap, which could get costly after several billion lookups over the course of several days of backtesting. 

can someone validate whether a 2d array of floats would have better performance than an array of pointers to structs?","optimizing for performance: array of struct pointers, or 2d array of values?"

0,"hi! i'm looking for an answer about how does slice capacity work. in other words, how does underline array increases when we append to the slice.

i understand this example (a little):

    	s := make([]int, 3)
    	fmt.printf(""len %d, cap %d\n"", len(s), cap(s)) //len 3, cap 3
    
    	s = append(s, 1, 2, 3, 4)
    	fmt.printf(""len %d, cap %d\n"", len(s), cap(s)) //len 7, cap 8
    	
    	s = append(s, 1, 2)
    	fmt.printf(""len %d, cap %d\n"", len(s), cap(s)) //len 9, cap 16

i initialized empty slice  `[0 0 0]`  with capacity 3, than i'm trying to append more values than initial capacity, so capacity is being twiced: (4 new values) \* 2 = 8. anyway, i still don't get, why capacity could not be 7.

the last `append` also doubles array capacity, but, i'm sure, the reason is not the same as it is for the first `append`. probably it's because `current_length(7)+amount_of_new_values(2) &gt; current_capacity(8)`.

docs [says](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#cap), that

&gt;the cap built-in function returns the capacity of v, according to its type:  
&gt;  
&gt;slice: the maximum length the slice can reach when resliced;

but what is ""reslicing""?

now i am not exactly sure what function coloring is i am assuming that it is a syntax in which the langauge starts looking more like a dsl and becomes hard to reason about.

0,"all.. still learning.. i have some simple microservices.. let's say they are as simple as printing out hello world... but instead of world they say something specific to their configuration. previously, each microservice i copy/pasted the same config.go file to. it loads a local &lt;env&gt;.json file where &lt;env&gt; is one of dev, prod, qa, etc. the idea here being depending on what env it is deployed in, it uses diff data from the .json file. simple enough.

i am finding, however that the code is mostly the same.. with some microservice specific code for custom config needs.

i am wondering if there is a way that a ""helper"" (shared code) function can define a generic interface that can be used in each microservice (e.g. types.config), and a function that reads the .json file (found in each microservice) into the config (that is defined in the helper/shared config.go file), but essentially uses a custom version of the types.config that is defined in each microservice. 

i have something like this, duplicated in every config file:

    var path string
    
    if env == ""dev"" {
    	path = ""../config/config.dev.json""
    } else {
    	path = ""./config."" + env + "".json""

    	fmt.println(err.error())
    }
    
    jsonparser := json.newdecoder(configfile)
    jsonparser.decode(&amp;config)

i was hoping i could put this code in a shared config.go that i then use in all my microservices, but can somehow pass it a custom config type that the microservice defines which would match the config.&lt;env&gt;.json format.. and that shared config.go getconfig() would return the loaded config info in each microservice.

hope that makes sense?

coming from a java background, this was relatively easy to do with interfaces. with go, i am still trying to translate some of the java oop stuff into how go would do it.

0,"what's the most practical way to keep tags out of the domain?

let's say you have a domain struct for account creation input:

```
type signupinfo struct {
    email string
    password string
}
```

...which gets passed to some domain account editing function:

```
func create(storage storage, info *signupinfo) error {
    // ...
    return nil
}
```

and in transport we're using json, so it's tempting and practical to just add the tags to the domain type:

```
type signupinfo struct {
    email string `json:""email""`
    password string `json:""password""`
}
```

now ideally this transport implementation coupling is hidden away, within a json package or somewhere else out of the domain.

one option is to make the domain type an interface.

```
type signupinfo interface {
    email() string
    password() string
}
```

...but this is awkward since using the pod types is much more natural and straightforward and the `create` function has little reason to need an interface instead of the plain data. this approach begs the case of why plain data should ever be accepted in any function, versus an interface or lambda returning the data.

another option is to mirror the struct in a implementation folder definition, and provide a conversion utility to make it easy to pass to the domain. e.g. in account/internal/json/data.go:

```
type signupinfo struct {
    email string `json:""email""`
    password string `json:""password""`
}

func (i signupinfo) todomain() *account.signupinfo {
    return &amp;account.signupinfo {
        email: i.email,
        password: i.password,
    }
}
```

this works well enough, but for me the coupling on the json tags in the domain has never produced a problem worth the extra effort of doing this for all domain inputs that have tags associated with them used in other layers, not to mention the extra object creation overhead.

is there another approach that somehow deals with this without the extra effort?

i wouldn't mind if tags could be added/applied to existing types at other sites, e.g. something like (no idea on best syntax):

(in account/internal/json)
```
tag signupinfo account.signupinfo {
    email `json:""email""`
    password `json:""password""`
}

// decodesignup reads signupinfo json from the given byte stream.
// the tagged type is returned, but the compiler can know the source type
// and handle conversions as needed?
func decodesignup(data io.reader) (*signupinfo, error) {
    var info signupinfo
    err := json.newdecoder(data).decode(&amp;signupinfo))
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    return &amp;info, nil
}
```

...in account/service.go...the tagged object could be converted automatically to the source tagged type by compiler?
```
func (s *streamservice) signup(data io.reader) error {
    info, err := s.codec.decodesignup(data)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return create(s.storage, info)
}

0,"situation: i have a wasm app that i implemented lua support for (via gopher-lua). i want to take full advantage of the fact that lua files do not need to be recompiled (hence embedding them in go, especially at development time, kind of defeats that purpose).

oh, and the fact it's lua is not the key, down the line i will likely use json or yaml for data.

i need to load a lua file that is present on the server - i repeat, server, not end user's filesystem. i understand [https://gobyexample.com/reading-files](https://gobyexample.com/reading-files) ioutil does not work on wasm target. i \*think\* i could use xml http request, just like js does xmlhttprequest(), but i can't find any docs/examples of that in golang (i believe it exists, but can't find anything more)

for serving the app for development, i am not using go - just python -m http.server. the end goal is to host this on github pages, in case that's relevant, so the solution must not rely on python either.

i know there are multiple embedding libraries and some seem to fall back to filesystem if possible but i am not sure which is the best (note, i am not using go modules, so pkger is out) - and many seem to rely on go generate, which is an additional step i'd rather not deal with, not manually and not in travis ci, which i plan to use to automate gh pages deployment.

so, i'm starting a new project and decided to go for go (heh) this time. at work, i've always had frontends hosted in dedicated web servers but i've also only written php and python at work so there's really no other option. the general recommendation regarding their build in web servers is ""don't"".

no, go's builtin stuff is pretty dope. so i was wondering if this is actually required. or rather what the general recommendation is because it is certainly possible but so is texting and driving and we all know how much of a good idea that is.

so, is it okay if i just expose my api on /api/ and serve the frontend on /? or should i still use nginx or maybe caddy (didn't look into that yet)?

https is irrelevant here. in my current setup i have a caddy running that is routing subdomains to containers and that caddy is actually doing https with le as well so i only need to serve the html / css / js files somehow.

0,"i'm still learning go, and am particularly intrigued by channels. i understand that a buffered channel is fifo, and an unbuffered channel will block if there is no data to read, or if the data previously sent hasn't been read yet.

what i'm looking to do is stream data from a source, let's say a stock ticker feed, parse the data slightly, and on some interval (which might vary), i want to be able to grab the latest data and then do something else with it.

i found this to be fairly straight forward using a rwmutex on a map, that is both updated and read from. but i'm curious how i'd be able to replicate this functionality with channels. 
the issue i'm running into in my head, is that the sender on an unbuffered channel would block until the reader is ready, and by that point the stock data might be older than i want. alternatively, with a buffered channel, i think i would still run into a similar issue, as the buffer is constantly being added to, but the reader gets the first data, as opposed to the most recent (last) data.

if i'm creating a web app with the intention of splitting out the frontend and backend, should the backend be written as a restful api, with each endpoint expecting json data? that would make the  frontend an api client, and it's buttons and forms etc would send json instead of say, form data, to the backend?

are there other design patterns around these kinds of architectures, and do any of them lend themselves in a more idiomatic way ?

```go
select {
	case: &lt;-ctx.done():
	...
	// timeout
	case: r:= &lt;-time.after(...)
	...
}
```

because of how ""select"" statements work, the channel operands of these two receive operations are evaluated exactly once. i.e., ctx.done() and time.after(...) are evaluated exactly once. the result is a set of channels to receive from and the corresponding values to send. since there is no default ""case"", the ""select"" statement blocks until at least one of the communications can proceed.

from [here](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#after), i understand that `time.after(...)` will be the case chosen to proceed, if the specified duration has elapsed.

what i've already read but do not completely understand:

from [here](https://golang.org/src/context/context.go?s=2460:6019#l357), i see that `done()` returns a channel with elements of type `struct{}`.

from [here](https://golang.org/src/context/context.go?s=2460:6019#l389) i see that `cancel()` closes `c.done`.

i know that closing a channel causes receive operations to return the zero value for the channel's element type without blocking. i also know that receiving from a ""nil"" channel blocks forever; i have a feeling that this fact fits into this picture somehow because i see `if c.done == nil` in the code. 

i can't see the whole 'chain' of how a `cancel()` results in causing `ctx.done()` to proceed first in the ""select"" statement.

please do correct me if i have any misunderstandings.","[question] how does `cancel()` result in`&lt;-ctx.done()` to be the case chosen in a ""select"" statement?"

0,"beginner here, i've got two structs, structured as so

    type one struct {
    	name string
            type string
    	age int
    }
    
    type onemsg struct {
    	name string
            type string
    	age *int
    }

a few things to note here. i'm collecting a message from rabbitmq, unmarshalling it and assigning it to struct onemsg. there reason i have it as a pointer is so i can check if this field is sent or not. in some instances it is expected that a user with send just [onemsg.name](https://onemsg.name). (this is a severely trimmed version of what the message actually is). 

i want to validate that the age field is required when there is a certain type. what i'm seeing is that when a message comes through without the age field, golang will default this int to a 0. age is a bad example, but for this int i will be considering 0 as a valid value. so checking for 0 will not be a valid test, and i did some research and it looks like if that type is a pointer and empty it will evaluate to nil, which works for me in terms of validation. 

my issue with that approach is when i convert this message back to struct 'one' to store in the db. i do the conversion like so

    a:= one {
    	name: msg.name,
    	type: msg.type,
    	age: msg.age,
    }

in the simple example here it will throw an error 

    cannot use 5 (type int) as type *int in field value

but in my actual code i have a big more complex of a structure, something like this -- 

    type (
    	// storedevent
    	storedevent struct {
    		required    bool                  `json:""required""`
    		instruction string                `json:""instruction""`
    		code        string                `json:""code""`
    		options     map[string]option     `json:""options""`
    		optionlists map[string]optionlist `json:""optionlists""`
    	}
    )
    
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // shared model
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    type (
    	// option for each custom field
    	option struct {
    		value      string `json:""value""`
    		sequence   *int   `json:""sequence""`
    		suboptions string `json:""suboptions""`
    	}
    
    	//optionlist for nested lists on a custom field
    	optionlist struct {
    		code    string            `json:""code""`
    		label   string            `json:""label""`
    		options map[string]option `json:""options""`
    	}
    )

so you can see in the shared model, that pointer \*int, and then i have the same struct setup on the storage side with just an type 'int' for that sequence field. it doesn't error out when i try to make that conversion, but rather it just drops the values for options and optionlists.

    	//convert store customfield command into plain customfield struct for validation
    	c := storedevent{
    		required:    cf.required,
    		instruction: cf.instruction,
    		code:        cf.code,
    		options:     map[uuid]option{},
    		optionlists: map[uuid]optionlist{},

0,"based on what i have read so far on this subreddit, it seems that knowing the go language itself is not a big deal and is just a tiny part of the desired skillset. what's more, junior positions for go developers are, according to my observations, not very common. what is common, though, is looking for experienced developers in other languages and back-end development in general who are ready to work with go. 

i have also noticed that the most popular technologies listed in job descriptions apart from go itself are: sql and being able to write efficient queries (very often it's postgres), git, docker, kubernetes, grpc (correct me if i am missing something important), understanding the basic internet protocols: tcp, http, udp. 

my question is, what is the best and pragmatic way to learn all these accompanying technologies to at least be able to get my foot in the door and get an interview? 

for example, even though i can write basic sql, i would not say that i am a master of it and know a lot about query optimization. should i read some book on that or are there more efficient ways?  

the same question regarding internet protocols.  there are great books on networking but is it really necessary to read huge books to match that requirement of ""basic knowledge of http, tcp, udp""? 

in general, if you have experience in hiring junior go developers, can you please elaborate on what level of skills you expect a candidate to have? 

i have been a data scientist for almost 1.5 years and have worked with a few programming languages (python for the most part, some c#, javascript and c++ at university), but my experience in back-end development is very limited in that i had to deploy models using flask (a python microframework), worked with docker (rather trivial cases of just creating an image and then uploading it to heroku), but never had the chance to be a back-end developer in a team.  that's why just learning a programming language at this stage is very easy (i have passed the tour of go and almost completed go by example), but i understand that this is not enough.

    func makec(xc *xc) (*yc, error) {

some functions never return an error (e.g. `makec`), but we still have to write `(*ret, error)` everywhere because on some day they will return an error and we'd have to rewrite all the functions that call'em.

now, given that errors almost never occur, and we can sacrifice a bit of performance, then we could put a pointer to error in parameters:

    func root(x *x) (*y, error) {
      var err error
      y := &amp;y{
        a: makea(&amp;err, x.a),
      }
      return y, err
    }

    func makea(perr *error, xa *xa) *ya {
      return &amp;ya{
        b: makeb(perr, xa.b),
        c: makec(perr, xa.c),
      }, nil
    }

    func makeb(perr *error, xb *xb) (*yb, error) {
      val, err := strconv.atoi(xb.str)
      if *perr == nil {
        *perr = err
      }
      return &amp;yb{ value: val }
    }

    func makec(perr *error, xc *xc) *yc {
      return &amp;yc{ value: xc.num }
    }

this would dramatically reduce the number of lines and thus improve readability. however that's doesn't look like the traditional go code-style.

0,"hi guys.

i've been working professionally for almost a year (as a backend developer working primarily on rails), and i've been looking into golang lately. 

i thought i'd try building a simple lru cache as a pet project. in the process, i realised how the flexibility ruby offers you can be extremely helpful. the ability to pass named arguments into a function, and then retrieve them easily, or choose a default value if the value is absent is pretty cool. for instance: -

    def initialize(name, **args): 
        # args is basically a hash (hash map). all named arguments after the first 
    # argument to initialize will be a part of the hash.
        
        # assign 'name' to instance variable '@name'
        @name = name 
        
        # if 'height' present in args, assign it toe '@height'. else args[:height] will
        # evaluate to nil, and default_height is assigned to '@height' instead.
        @height = args[:height] || default_height

i thought i'd build a small package that allows me to at least come close to this and this resulted in: [https://github.com/dannypz97/arghpacker](https://github.com/dannypz97/arghpacker). i can create a variable of type *argpacker* (which is basically a map) and can then add/modify values, or retrieve values  by key(or a default value if the key is not present in argpacker). 

the code itself is very small - about 30 lines.

i plan to use this in my projects. i want to know if it's a bad idea since i don't want any weird ideas (or too many weird ideas) in my projects. i understand that this might have some overhead of its own, but i think this might have some benefits as well.

i want to know what you guys might think. constructive criticism is appreciated.",packing args into a type for passing data into functions easily?
0," hello everyone!

i have this problem and i am not able to solve it and i want to discuss it with you in case someone can give me another point of view.

i usually have a remote terminal open against one of the servers where i run the dnstop command to get query statistics to dns.

so far everything is clear, but as my head never stops i began to think that instead of having a terminal it would be practical to be able to consult or run the dnstop but via the website. and well ... i got down to work, i searched ..... i documented ... and in the end i found what for me was the most suitable solution, which was to use gotty.

the idea itself was good, from the console it executed `gotty dnstop -4 -6 -q -r l3 eth0`  
 and automatically had on the web page [`http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080`](http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080/) the command dnstop showing me statistics.

so far fantastic, but my desire for perfectionism led me to automate it, in reality a not complex process and i solved it as follows by creating this script:

`#! / bin / bash`

`set -e`

`set -x`

`term = linux`

`echo ""executing gotty for dnstop ...""`

`/ usr / local / go_projects / bin / gotty --term xterm dnstop -4 -6 -q -r -l 3 eth0`

then with crontab -e create the cron:

`@ reboot (sleep 30 ; /usr/local/execte_gotty.sh)`

if i manually launch the script it works, but if i let it auto-run after a reboot, when accessing via web, this is the result.

    if err != nil {

    }

    if scanner.err() != nil {

normally this works fine. however, if the size of the data written to standard out exceeds `buf.maxscantokensize` which is 64 kb then the program just hangs with no errors. the underlying command finishes, but neither of the scanner for loops are hit. i found that if i swap the position of the `errscanner.scan()` and `scanner.scan()` then the issue no longer occurs. this is what i mean:

    cmd := exec.command(args[0], args[1:]...)

    stdout, err := cmd.stdoutpipe()
    if err != nil {
            log.fatal(err)

good day,

i've just published a file sharing cli tool. this enables you to share your files directly from your computer, you can share a single file, directory, or multiple files.

the use case is that something i need to transfer some files from my machine to my cellphone or another machine, and i need to upload my files to either dropbox, google drive or mega, just to transfer a single file. 

with this tool, i just write a command to specify which file i want to share, and then just share the url. or in the case that you want to transfer a file from my computer to my cellphone the tool generates a qr with the link right there from the terminal.

i would really appreciate any feedback and ideas on how can i improve this tool.

0,"hi, 

i'm part of a team that maintains a large-ish ""ai"" service which executes hundreds of thousands of queries every minute. the service is fairly modern, managed and deployed on azure with kubernetes and docker containers in datacenters over the world.

the individual backend microservice containers are built in c++ on top of grpc. every backend container handles many concurrent requests. 

we place quite a bit of emphasis on performance, and routinely deploy updates that improve scale, which directly impacts our bottom line in terms of margin, or sometimes we pass those savings onto the customer. i myself have optimized some of the core pieces with intrisics that we do have available on some of the high-end azure vms just to squeeze some 5% more perf. this is to say that we ***do*** spend the 80% extra effort to get the 20% extra benefit.

that said, the multithreading aspect of the service has not been given too much attention. since each microservice handles many requests, our concurrency is handled by a barebones threadpool which distributes the work to those independent requests. so we have a simple threadpool that puts very optimized tasks on threads. i should also say that like most ""ai"" stuff, the processing is memory bound, and not cpu bound. 

i'm wondering if i'd get some efficiency out of golang compared to a fairly optimized service written in c++. i might just protoype the service these days just to have some numbers to compare, but wanted to gut check with people first, especially since i'm new to go. i'm also not really sure how much effort this prototyping would be, given the above parameters (e.g. it needs to talk grpc, and call some very optimized c++ code).

hoping for a positive answer given that from the little i've read, it looks like golang was designed for my use case.

thanks!

one of the packages handles network connections. once it does some handling on the connection, it would hand off a network message to a function that interprets that information. that interpretation part is particular to the executable, so i was writing a function for each of those executables that would do the interpretations, and thought i could send their interpretation function as a parameter to the network package function.

i was able to create, in the package, a 

    type command func(string) (string,error)

then in the signature create, in the package, a parameter of ""commandinterpret command"" and it seemed happy to compile. that package would then call commandinterpret(networkclientmessage) to get the task done and receive the results as a string and an error, if any.

except i can't pass the function, because in the executable main package, i have to pass a string to the package function and it doesn't like that it has an assignment mismatch because i'm passing the argument (function) and it can't return the (string,error). i'm not sure, but i think if the type didn't pass a string and return a (string, error) it might compile...but that doesn't seem like it's very useful. maybe passing functions to functions only works within the same package?

at this point i'm assuming i'm taking the wrong route in trying to pass the function this way. maybe it's not possible at all. or is there?

summary: i want to create a generic function placeholder with a signature into a package so individual programs can have custom functions to handle a particular task but use the same package for some common work, but i can't get that function passed to the package without errors in compilation. suggestions?",passing a function as a parameter in another package?

0,"in my sse handler, i execute a command in a go routine and send the results to the `output` channel. then, i simply range over `output` to get the results, stdout and stderr, line by line. that data is then written to the http.responsewriter with `data:` to signify a message and `\n\n` to terminate the message. stdout and stderr should get streamed to the client line by line just like what you'd see in a terminal.

for quick commands like `ls`, this works most of the time but sometimes the browser only updates with the last few lines of the output or nothing at all. i do not think there is a problem on the server. i've verified that the data received from `range output` does come in line by line. it seems something is wrong on the client side such that it doesn't get all of the data every time.

so i was planing to make this process asynchronous

hi gophers!

after a failed attempt to learn python which i never liked but forced myself to study i switched over to golang after combating my fears of the language and how the code tends to look. i have to admit that i'm having a blast studying the language. the previous language i learned was lua which was one of the languages i understood the best which helped me learn it with ease, however, i realized that it won't get me anywhere if i ever want a career someday in the future.

learning golang is an absolute roller coaster of fun, even for a complete beginner programmer with no prior education in cs. as a way to learn the language, i decided to do what i did with lua, create a basic calculator to help me understand it better. i wish to share it with you and hopefully get some feedback on how i can make it better and what can be improved to learn further.

there are a few things i wish to learn if it is possible

* possibility to add more numbers for calculation rather than two? (probably too ambitious for a beginner)
* shrink the code in size while having the same functionality (pretty sure my code is bloated.)
* use more errors for things like ""wrong operator"" etc, i wish to learn more about using error handing in golang

and much more.

0,"hi everyone,

i like how many ides like goland and vscode have capabilities for quick find where you can find files based on their file names or file paths - it saves a lot of time, compared to wandering around in the file directory tree on the left!

and as most of you working on github probably know when reviewing pull requests there's a copy to clipboard button on each file you're reviewing - this way you can quickly go to the ide and through quick find go to that file. i do that a lot when reviewing - switching back and forth between browser and ide.

but i found that that's not the most optimal flow when doing code review so i created a chrome browser extension called **line clipper for github** (my first browser extension ever actually) which allows you to simply click on any line number and you'll get copied to your clipboard not only the file path, but also the line number suffixed to that, so you can go to that specific place in code in your ide. i find this saves me a lot of time and doesn't break my focus. (maybe github will eventually implement something similar natively, but for now there's no such thing)

by the way, this could possibly come in hand to some fuzzy finder terminal users, it's not necessarily ide specific.

i'd love to hear your opinions and also welcome contributions to the open source project: [https://github.com/nickymateev/line-clipper/](https://github.com/nickymateev/line-clipper/)

the project is an alternative to [godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog) but has a few differences. the most important thing is that godog is a separate binary that compiles our code under the hood. it has several disadvantages:

* no debugging (breakpoints) in the test. sometimes it’s useful to go through the whole execution step by step
* metrics don’t count the test run this way
* some style checkers recognise tests as dead code
* it’s impossible to use built-in features like build constraints.

i'm new go learner, i'm so sorry if my question is bad.

currently, i want to build a backend for an application which is used to listing properties and manage appointments...

i'm consider about building a restful api with [asp.net](https://asp.net) core 3 or go. after i review some docs, go has a powerful thing is gorountines are functions  that run concurrently to resolve request. instead of [asp.net](https://asp.net) core, we will have to use async to resolve requests in a thread.

 it would be helpful if you could provide suggestions or feedback.

thank you so much for your time.",choose go or asp.net core 3 to build a restful api

it is a single binary file to create and manage r/virtualmachines based on virtualbox.

it started as a shell script with some go binaries as utilities, but now it has been fully rewritten in the awesome r/golang

**vermin** is mainly built to enable quick creation of vms and provide handy commands as well such as cross copying files and port forwarding.

it accomplishes this by simply using r/virtualbox and wraps some ssh commands as well.

i hope anybody needs a simple solution to create and work with vms to find vermin useful.

if you like **vermin**, please star the project at [https://github.com/mhewedy/vermin](https://github.com/mhewedy/vermin) and start use it.

0,"so i am coming from a a python and js background, and can write oop code on both, and have a pretty strong grasp of interfaces for ts as an example. but go interfaces really confuse me. so far, i have formed two theories about go interfaces. 

- an empty interface can be used to specify an unknown type, followed by a type assertion if being used something. 
- an interface can sort of used extend other types, like how structs have receivers (this seems more like python oop with self to me). 

both these two theories are guesses, but as i explore more libraries in go, i see some of them often implement interfaces. instead of just copying pasting code and just get it to work, i would like to really understand interfaces (maybe with a python based follow along?).

iam quite new to docker and gitlab-ci. ive read a lot of blogposts but i always missing a piece of the puzzle to really understand, how i ship my golang app in a docker image.  


i have a git repository for my go app. inside this repository, i have a folder where i store different dockerfiles. one dockerfile for the pipeline and development itself, where the dockerfile contains the runtime environment for the app without the app binary. and one dockerfile which should be used to build the docker image where the go binary from this repository is alredy included, so this image could be used on qa stage for example and should be build after a merge is successfull. 

my project folder looks like this:

    .
    ├── client
    ├── dockerfiles
    │   ├── ci
    │   │   └── dockerfile
    │   └── prod
    │       └── dockerfile
    ├── go.mod
    ├── go.sum
    ├── main.go
    ├── makefile
    └── readme.md

maybe this is the wrong way, may correct me if iam wrong, but if i want to ship the binary in the docker image, which is build from prod/dockerfile, the build step is a part of the dockerfile itself. general, i build the app with the makefile comes with the source code.  


iam wondering now how to reference  the code, make build and at least the builded binary in the dockerfile to build the image. i dont have to checkout the gitlab project in the dockerfile again because this is alredy done by the gitlab-ci. but how to reference it then? or is this wrong in general?",how to build and ship my god.mod based go app with docker and gitlab-ci

i was using the wrong method for the job. i needed the [start](https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#cmd.start) method instead of [run](https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#cmd.run). thanks /u/sthussey!

i'm doing a random exercise for personal learning and was hoping someone could help me understand a better way to achieve my objective.

i'm using the [run](https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#cmd.run) method to do something trivial like sleep for 10 seconds (but this could be any other command that takes some amount of time). regardless of how long this command takes, i would like to immediately print its pid for my viewing. then, when the command is over, it should print that it completed. a working solution is posted below, but is there a way i can get rid of the `for` loop in my `getpid` function? the reason that is there is because of the possibility of the `getpid` function starting before the `startprocess` function which would result in a runtime error because the process is nil. as of right now, `getpid` is pretty much waiting until it gets a process back before sending the pid into the channel.

thank you!

0,"i am working through the beginner docs for golang; 

https://golang.org/doc/code.html

and in the very first example they tell you to install your hello world program globally

&gt;  now you can build and install that program with the go tool:
&gt; 
&gt; $ go install example.com/user/hello
&gt; $
&gt; 
&gt; this command builds the hello command, producing an executable binary. it then installs that binary as $home/go/bin/hello (or, under windows, %userprofile%\go\bin\hello.exe). 

i was kinda confused by this since ""installing"" software like this is usually not what i want, at least not something that would be managed by the go software like this, but i was just gonna ignore it 

but then i get further down and now they are importing that globally accessible binary thing into another program;

&gt; import (

0,"i posted on here a few days about how best to store config in a central place for my microservices.

i ended up writing my own really simple service that exposes an endpoint and allows the services in my network to fetch the latest config as they start up.

this works great i just have a few questions / wanted some advice around the flow of the service.

for example, my config service spins up, then service-a queries config:5050/config and fetches a json file of the latest config via a standard http.get.

so currently i have a

    // getconfig gets our application config.
    func getconfig() models.config {
    	resp, err := http.get(fmt.sprintf(""localhost/config""))
    	if err != nil {
    		log.fatal(err)
    	}
    	defer resp.body.close()
    
    	var config models.config
    	err = json.newdecoder(resp.body).decode(&amp;config)
    	if err != nil {
    		log.fatal(err)
    	}
    
    	return config
    }

at the moment this just sits in the config service in a \`request\` package as i didn't want to have to duplicate the http.get(url) in each of my services, so my service can just call:

&gt;c := request.getconfig()

this feels a bit weird to me but i'm not sure of the best practices to use here within a microservice architecture. would it be best to create an execute library and have that execute the http call so it moves away from the config package? as it seems strange to have a call to the service's endpoint within the services directory.

0,"when you build services that have an api, do you ever separate your api version from the service build version?

i think that an api version is very important for any consumer because that version is part of the api contract. i usually manually set the api version to a whole number and increment the value when i make backward incompatible changes.

the service build number/version doesn't have anything to do with the api contract and instead deals with the implementation of the service itself. for example, say you use version 3 of my api and find a bug. when the bug is fixed, the api version is still 3, but the service build version/number changes. this number is typically set automatically at build time to either the git commit hash or to the git tag name (if one exists).

that's my current approach, but i wanted to see what other people think of this and if there are any documented patterns for doing this or for doing something better?",service api version vs build version
0,"hi guys, 

hope y'all doing okay during these times. 

i thought i understood how pointers work, but today i had to use them and while i got it working i have some trouble understanding \*why\* it is working. 

here is that code that i wrote in the beginning, but my ""db"" doesn't print any values:

    func main() {
    	var db []person
    	addperson(db) 
    	fmt.printf(""%v+"", db)
    }
    
    func addperson(db []person) { 
    	entry := person{name: ""alice""}
    	db = append(db, entry) 
    }
    
    type person struct {
    	name string
    }

that is - to my understanding-  because the function ""addperson"" receives a new copy of the slice. alright, so we need to pass the adress of the db to the function to manipulate the underlying slice directly: 

    addperson(&amp;db)
    
    func addperson(db *[]person) { 
    	entry := person{name: ""alice""}
    	db = append(db, entry) 
    }

this however, gives me error: 

    ./prog.go:16:13: first argument to append must be slice; have *[]person

(which reads: ""pointer to a slice of person""?)   
but i also use \*variable to retrieve a value from a pointer right? so why isn't it ""value of a pointer to a slice of person""? 

if i change the append to: 

    db = append(*db, entry) 

to explicitly retrieve the values the compiler is complaining again: 

    ./prog.go:16:5: cannot use append(*db, entry) (type []person) as type *[]person in assignment

which i have trouble understanding. it works when i finally change it to: 

    *db = append(*db, entry) // works but i don't  really understand why

so i'm a bit lost here. especially because i thought that a slice is itself only a reference.   
am i doing something wrong here regardless of the pointer issue? 

can someone explain to me or point me to a ressource to understand my issue here?

the fah client api uses telnet, so converting a message-passing-based api to a set of functions was a bit complicated. it does seem to have an unsupported command line interface but it simply doesn't do anything.

0,"hi everyone,

i've been working on a peer-to-peer project that presented me with an interesting problem.  i need to maintain a large collection of structs that look like this:

    type entry struct {
        ttl time.time
        somedata interface{}
    }

the object of the game is:

1. to update the ttls as messages from peers arrive
2. to expire entries if the ttl is exceeded

ttl updates come in the form of a `(peer.id, ttl)` tuple, so i needed a datastructure that provides:

1. fast keyed lookups (like a map)
2. fast sorting ... but by *ttl*, not by key!

oh, and the whole damn thing is highly concurrent ...

after fiddling around with some ugly lock-based solutions, i discovered the wonderful world of treaps!  more specifically, the wonderful world of purely-functional, immutable treaps.  after a spectacular performance gain in my project, i decided to move this treap implementation into its own library.

please let me know if you spot any bugs!

also, if anyone here is an expert on treaps, i'd really like to optimize this a bit.  most of the performance benefits i'm getting are related to improvements in time-complexity over my previous approach, as well as the fact that readers no longer wait for writers.  that said, i've done _zero_ code optimization, so i suspect there's some low-hanging fruit.  for example, i'm wondering if the the `upsert` function be re-written iteratively to shave off a few allocations.  here are my current benchmarks (which are probably shakey):

note: this is an experimental project for demonstration only, you may skip the chinese stuff in readme, just head to `container/di.go` for core concept(`di_test.go` should be an easy example to start).

it may be similar to facebook's injection project at first glance, but something is different.

the container **requires** you to define a `constructor()` method for each component, and it will return the fully-functional component, well, the pointer to it.

workflow:

1. register a component by `dic.register(new(componenttype))`, simply provide a zero value pointer, it will be used as a shell(or a template) to construct the real component.
2. after registering all the components, you can call `dic.get(name)` to grab the functional component by its **type name**.

when you call `dic.get`, the underlying initialization will start(lazy initialization compared to facebook's `populate` method). 

the philosophy is simple, a dependency graph stores the dependency information to construct the requested component, so the leaf components in the dependency tree will be initialized first, and then the upper-level component.

remember the zero value pointer(shell or template) we passed in `register` method? it will be populated with all dependency the component needs which is declared in struct tag with key `dep`, after that, it will call `constructor` method of the shell, and pass the **value type** as the receiver.

this is the tricky part, if a component has no dependency, only a constructor call is needed to construct the component, you put the cook recipes in constructor method(you can call outer functions in the method) and it's done,  di system will call it for you.

or otherwise, as you have been passed a populated receiver, the populated fields(and they are functional already) could be used in your ad-hoc initialization process too, that would be a great help.
