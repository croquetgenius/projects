all the republicans i know respect authority and would never attack police and insult them the way these protestors are. 

are these a specific type of republican or are these not republicans and just crazy people? 
are there some republicans who do not respect the police?

i understand protesting is their right but they’re honestly kind of terrifying with it. why can’t they peacefully protest and not bring out rocket launchers and push around cops? 

thanks for reading sorry if this is a slightly uneducated question.

i’ve never never interacted with republicans who behave like this before they’re always so respectful to me and my country and my country’s laws so i’m a little shocked at watching american news lately.",soo these quarantine protestors..,0

all the republicans i know respect authority and would never attack police and insult them the way these protestors are. 

are these a specific type of republican or are these not republicans and just crazy people? 
are there some republicans who do not respect the police?

i understand protesting is their right but they’re honestly kind of terrifying with it. why can’t they peacefully protest and not bring out rocket launchers and push around cops? 

thanks for reading sorry if this is a slightly uneducated question.
