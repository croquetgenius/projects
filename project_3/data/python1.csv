ambrevar xyz guix advance index html  just why i think that guix is interesting precisely for such projects      it offers build from source  as well as retrieval of pre compiled binary packages  packages work exactly the same in both cases    currently  it has currently  around        packages  many of them are very recent  guix also offers an own linux distribution   which  when looking at standard open source packages and libraries  compares very well to arch linux    handling is similar to conda or pip   virtualenv  in general very easy  but not yet as polished and at some points perhaps requiring more experience  with the advantage of a more unified sytem    however it is not confined to one language or one build system  and works for many systems and languages  for example it would work superbly for a system which for example combines c  or c   with boost libraries  python  and perhaps in future rust extension modules which replace c modules using rusts s c abi   it supports many different build systems  among them python setup tools  make  the gnu configure   make   install  cmake   and many more   it can work on top of unix like systems like debian and arch  offering up to data library versions on top of a very stable base system   i guess that on windows  it will require using the wsl subsystem  but as compatibility of wsl with linux improves  it should support that equally well     as a  purely functional  package manager a la nix  it offers reproducible builds and isolated testing environments  i think that it is much easier to use than nix    it offers a  rollback  functionality  meaning that if a package update ever breaks your build  you can simply go back to exactly the last previous configuration  or any previous version   the configuration you use can be put into a single file which can be version controlled  and used on another platform  also  configurations for different projects can be completely isolated from each others  this does not only relates to python packages  but also to build tools and such    in difference to nix  both its configuration and implementation is done in guile  an established scheme dialect  scheme is minimalistic and easy to learn  this has the advantage of using an easy to learn  established  very mature general purpose language for configuration and definition of packages  if

charset utf         or gui  such as   datagrip   tool to create database in your own db server       modify       sqlalchemy  database  uri       and       sqlalchemy  database  base       in file

console  execute it       using datagrip  you should get someting like this       datagrip             rest        what is       rest         rest stands for        resource  representational state transfer       it s a stateless communications protocol  the core concept of rest is       resource        in rest point of view  each concept that can be abstracted is called a resource  let s say name  age  email can be abstract as a user model so user can be represented as a resource        transfer means resources are transferred from server side to client side        in rest world  each operation is operated on some kind of resource  and has pre defined       verb       to describe it  such as       post       means to create a resource        put       means to update a resource        delete       means to delete a resource  these three verb is mainly used you can check it out   here   for more detail            benefits of rest        use rest you will get some advantages       each       uri        or url  is for one specific resource  it makes your code clean and         self describing     self describing means what you see is what you get you can make a quick guess about what you will get from the uri       resource is separated from view function  which means you can change your backend logic function without affect others only if your take the same arguments and return the same resource  which is easy to achieve       it s is stateless  which means you don t need to worry about the surrounded context before you make request for resource            unified response structure        using rest we should make the response that we return       remain tha same        in most case the response data should contains two parts        meta       and       data                   meta       means the info about the request is it a success or a failure   is it successfully understood by server but that request is not allowed              data       means the resource that request want to get       in this project  the response  are defined as follow          python         data   data      error  code   error  code      error  msg   error  msg                    for example  when a request want to get a user  let s say       user          he may get          json         data         id          name    john       web  site        email    hrui    gmail com       create  time                              update  time                                  error  code          error  msg    success                          some thing you should aware             basically we don t directly return json data in our handler function instead we return object       so before return to frontend we should marshal our object to json format       in flask you can use       jsonify       function to do this to transfer costumed data to json you can rewrite       json jsonencoder       function       in this project  the json jsonencoder is rewrite as          py   class jsonencoder json jsonencoder      def default self  value     any     if isinstance value   datetime datetime  datetime date       return value strftime   y  m  d  h  m  s      if isinstance value  apiresponse      return value get      if isinstance value  basemodel      return value marshal      if isinstance value  types generatortype      return   self default v  for v in value      return json jsonencoder default self  value                and register to flask app          py   app json  encoder   jsonencoder               finlay  before you return data to frontend  call       jsonify       function          py   def schema query  model  basequerymodel  response  model  apidatatype      def decorator func       wraps func     def wrapper self      kwargs     callable        some logic           jsonify function is called here    return jsonify func self      kwargs       return wrapper    return decorator                    unified exception handling        exception       doesn t       means bad  on the other side  it s is crucial to let user know that they are doing something that the server can not satisfied  and they need to known why       in order to give the user corresponding error info  and to raise exception properly  this project use a file       exceptions       to clarify all exceptions         py   class serverexception exception     code           class argumentinvalid serverexception     code                     you may add a       message       property to each class       we want to raise exception in our code a exception handler function is need          py   def handle  exception e     tuple  dict  str  union  union  int  str  list    any      union  int  any        code          if isinstance e   serverexception      code   e code   logger exception e    exc     v for v in traceback format  exc limit     split    n        if str code              send  dingding  alert request url  request args  request json  repr e   exc     return   error  code   code   error  msg   str e    traceback   exc   code               then register to app          py   app register  error  handler exception  handle  exception                      note        if you want to raise exception directly in your code and don t want to write exception handler function  all exceptions       must be       subclass of       werkzeug exceptions           unified query model  response model and databasemodel        in object oriented programming  it s better to keep your arguments to be a single object than many separated args  it s so in python and flask        let s say you want to query a user by it name and or age and or email  it s better to write          py    def get  user filter  obj      pass               not          py    def get  user name age email      pass                        this project use query model for request arguments            py   class basequerymodel basemodel      def     init     self      kwargs  dict      super       init     drop  missing false      kwargs         some logic                   and       query model args validation       can be write in basemodel               this project use response model for response results            py   class baseresponsemodel basemodel      def     init     self      kwargs      super       init         kwargs         some logic                         don t forget to jsonify your response model before return to frontend                     this project use orm for managing database              object relational mapping       is used for communicate with database it free you from writing sql statements  keeps you       coding in objected way                python   from flask  sqlalchemy import sqlalchemy   class base db model  surrogatepk         database model that contains crud operations          abstract       true       some logic that all subclass should inherited                           this project use alembic for updating database           py   from sqlalchemy ext declarative import declarative  base   meta   declarative  base     db   sqlalchemy model  class meta    class base db model  surrogatepk         database model that contains crud operations                        alembic       is kind of like git it keeps every version of your database model  it will generate a folder       alembic             alembic versions       all versions are stored in       versions                  swagger or not swagger        swagger provide an automatic way to generate documentation so you don t need to update your docs yourself  web frontend developer can check it out for developing       but in my experience fronted developer and backend developer discuss product requirements before developing automatic generated docs are not specified enough to declare requirements  so this project don t use it       if you want to use swagger check it out   here             structure of this project        iamge              mvc model  view  controller        is a typical design pattern  this porject is programed in mvc pattern  but is not strictly stick to it               model   models in this project   store information about resources         specifically  they are         database model       orm       is in this folder which transfer your python object to database rows        querymodel  arguments  organized together as one model  so frontend send args to backend  backend put them together to create a new object to do arguments validation work  because use model some default functions can be bound to it        responsemodel  resources that are returned to frontend               view  resources in this project   do routing work        views are handling routing work  when a url is request  view function know what logic function to call               controller  handlers in this project   do logic work        handlers are used to to logic work such as       crud       work               some other folders files        folder       exemptions       store customized exceptions file and a send error to dingding file       folder       blueprints       is used to organize all apis       folder       tests       store all       unittest case              using test case       is a good way to keep project running well when new feature is developed            n     problem        query one table    times each time fetch one row is slow than query one table one time to fetch    rows             orm       release programer from writing original sql statements but it also introduce some new problems  the database query       n         problem is a common one       let s say you have two tables        user       and       post        one user can write many posts  consider the scenario blow             you have a page which need to show ten random users  info  and also you are asked to show all posts for each user             what will orm do in this scenario        first        query user table       once       to get ten users        second       for loop users to query post table for each user at one time  orm query post table       ten       times      code would be something like this          py   users   user query limit       query once   for user in users    posts   post query filter  by user  id  user id       query ten times      all times query table is                      if you query user table   time and get       n       users then you need query post table       n        times to get posts all times query tables are         n        this is called       n         problem may be called   n more reasonable        in fact if you are familiar with join  there is no need to query n   times       so in your project       carefully       deal with this scenario       facebook provide a solution called       dataloader       to solve this             the downside of rest        although rest has many advantages it does has some disadvantages       the major downside is waste of resources  such as network io       in rest you query a resource you get       all fields       of it  in many case you just want a part of it       another problem is url mixed in rest each resource need a url when there are many resources  managing these urls could be a difficult problem       because of all these  another framework       graphql       is invented by facebook       in       graphql        there is one url and you write query to request the fields that you want to get  it fix rest s problem       if you want to know more about graphql  check it out         here                improvements        in this project  some code can be abstracted as a base class  in       handlers        basically they all did crud work  with only different args and slightly different logic       if curd work has been abstracted as a base class  the code could be cleaner             some tools should be mentioned              docker       using docker to run project in different platform             docker compose       a tool that provides you easy way to manage docker             makefile       auto compile tools that can save you a lot of time             pre commit       auto format you code before you commit these keep your project well formatted especially useful when work in teams               travis ci com     auto integration platform  which can run your tests automatically after you push               coveralls io     get test coverage report after tests has been run for example you can use travis ci for ci and let it send report to coveralls               codebeat co     calculate the complexity of your code               shields io     provide beautiful metadata badge for your project you can just simply put your github repository url in blank it will automatically generate suggested badges for you             a word        this project is coded in python    using flask restful framework

server       modify       sqlalchemy  database  uri       and       sqlalchemy  database  base       in file       settings py       to your own setting       run          shell script   python     m

open datagrip  connect to mysql database       use any editor to open       data sql       copy it s content to console  execute it       using datagrip  you should get someting like this       datagrip             rest        what is       rest         rest stands for        resource  representational state transfer       it s a stateless communications protocol  the core concept of rest is       resource        in rest point of view  each concept that can be abstracted is called a resource  let s say name  age  email can be abstract as a user model so user can be represented as a resource        transfer means resources are transferred from server side to client side        in rest world  each operation is operated on some kind of resource  and has pre defined       verb       to describe it  such as       post       means to create a resource        put       means to update a resource        delete       means to delete a resource  these three verb is mainly used you can check it out   here   for more detail            benefits of rest        use rest you will get some advantages       each       uri        or url  is for one specific resource  it makes your code clean and         self describing     self describing means what you see is what you get you can make a quick guess about what you will get from the uri       resource is separated from view function  which means you can change your backend logic function without affect others only if your take the same arguments and return the same resource  which is easy to achieve       it s is stateless  which means you don t need to worry about the surrounded context before you make request for resource            unified response structure        using rest we should make the response that we return       remain tha same        in most case the response data should contains two parts        meta       and       data                   meta       means the info about the request is it a success or a failure   is it successfully understood by server but that request is not allowed              data       means the resource that request want to get       in this project  the response  are defined as follow          python         data   data      error  code   error  code      error  msg   error  msg                    for example  when a request want to get a user  let s say       user          he may get          json         data         id          name    john       web  site        email    hrui    gmail com       create  time                              update  time                                  error  code          error  msg    success                          some thing you should aware             basically we don t directly return json data in our handler function instead we return object       so before return to frontend we should marshal our object to json format       in flask you can use       jsonify       function to do this to transfer costumed data to json you can rewrite       json jsonencoder       function       in this project  the json jsonencoder is rewrite as          py   class jsonencoder json jsonencoder      def default self  value     any     if isinstance value   datetime datetime  datetime date       return value strftime   y  m  d  h  m  s      if isinstance value  apiresponse      return value get      if isinstance value  basemodel      return value marshal      if isinstance value  types generatortype      return   self default v  for v in value      return json jsonencoder default self  value                and register to flask app          py   app json  encoder   jsonencoder               finlay  before you return data to frontend  call       jsonify       function          py   def schema query  model  basequerymodel  response  model  apidatatype      def decorator func       wraps func     def wrapper self      kwargs     callable        some logic           jsonify function is called here    return jsonify func self      kwargs       return wrapper    return decorator                    unified exception handling        exception       doesn t       means bad  on the other side  it s is crucial to let user know that they are doing something that the server can not satisfied  and they need to known why       in order to give the user corresponding error info  and to raise exception properly  this project use a file       exceptions       to clarify all exceptions         py   class serverexception exception     code           class argumentinvalid serverexception     code                     you may add a       message       property to each class       we want to raise exception in our code a exception handler function is need          py   def handle  exception e     tuple  dict  str  union  union  int  str  list    any      union  int  any        code          if isinstance e   serverexception      code   e code   logger exception e    exc     v for v in traceback format  exc limit     split    n        if str code              send  dingding  alert request url  request args  request json  repr e   exc     return   error  code   code   error  msg   str e    traceback   exc   code               then register to app          py   app register  error  handler exception  handle  exception                      note        if you want to raise exception directly in your code and don t want to write exception handler function  all exceptions       must be       subclass of       werkzeug exceptions           unified query model  response model and databasemodel        in object oriented programming  it s better to keep your arguments to be a single object than many separated args  it s so in python and flask        let s say you want to query a user by it name and or age and or email  it s better to write          py    def get  user filter  obj      pass               not          py    def get  user name age email      pass                        this project use query model for request arguments            py   class basequerymodel basemodel      def     init     self      kwargs  dict      super       init     drop  missing false      kwargs         some logic                   and       query model args validation       can be write in basemodel               this project use response model for response results            py   class baseresponsemodel basemodel      def     init     self      kwargs      super       init         kwargs         some logic                         don t forget to jsonify your response model before return to frontend                     this project use orm for managing database              object relational mapping       is used for communicate with database it free you from writing sql statements  keeps you       coding in objected way                python   from flask  sqlalchemy import sqlalchemy   class base db model  surrogatepk         database model that contains crud operations          abstract       true       some logic that all subclass should inherited                           this project use alembic for updating database           py   from sqlalchemy ext declarative import declarative  base   meta   declarative  base     db   sqlalchemy model  class meta    class base db model  surrogatepk         database model that contains crud operations                        alembic       is kind of like git it keeps every version of your database model  it will generate a folder       alembic             alembic versions       all versions are stored in       versions                  swagger or not swagger        swagger provide an automatic way to generate documentation so you don t need to update your docs yourself  web frontend developer can check it out for developing       but in my experience fronted developer and backend developer discuss product requirements before developing automatic generated docs are not specified enough to declare requirements  so this project don t use it       if you want to use swagger check it out   here             structure of this project        iamge              mvc model  view  controller        is a typical design pattern  this porject is programed in mvc pattern  but is not strictly stick to it               model   models in this project   store information about resources         specifically  they are         database model       orm       is in this folder which transfer your python object to database rows        querymodel  arguments  organized together as one model  so frontend send args to backend  backend put them together to create a new object to do arguments validation work  because use model some default functions can be bound to it        responsemodel  resources that are returned to frontend               view  resources in this project   do routing work        views are handling routing work  when a url is request  view function know what logic function to call               controller  handlers in this project   do logic work        handlers are used to to logic work such as       crud       work               some other folders files        folder       exemptions       store customized exceptions file and a send error to dingding file       folder       blueprints       is used to organize all apis       folder       tests       store all       unittest case              using test case       is a good way to keep project running well when new feature is developed            n     problem        query one table    times each time fetch one row is slow than query one table one time to fetch    rows             orm       release programer from writing original sql statements but it also introduce some new problems  the database query       n         problem is a common one       let s say you have two tables        user       and       post        one user can write many posts  consider the scenario blow             you have a page which need to show ten random users  info  and also you are asked to show all posts for each user             what will orm do in this scenario        first        query user table       once       to get ten users        second       for loop users to query post table for each user at one time  orm query post table       ten       times      code would be something like this          py   users   user query limit       query once   for user in users    posts   post query filter  by user  id  user id       query ten times      all times query table is                      if you query user table   time and get       n       users then you need query post table       n        times to get posts all times query tables are         n        this is called       n         problem may be called   n more reasonable        in fact if you are familiar with join  there is no need to query n   times       so in your project       carefully       deal with this scenario       facebook provide a solution called       dataloader       to solve this             the downside of rest        although rest has many advantages it does has some disadvantages       the major downside is waste of resources  such as network io       in rest you query a resource you get       all fields       of it  in many case you just want a part of it       another problem is url mixed in rest each resource need a url when there are many resources  managing these urls could be a difficult problem       because of all these  another framework       graphql       is invented by facebook       in       graphql        there is one url and you write query to request the fields that you want to get  it fix rest s problem       if you want to know more about graphql  check it out         here                improvements        in this project  some code can be abstracted as a base class  in       handlers        basically they all did crud work  with only different args and slightly different logic       if curd work has been

1,okay  i have to admit that after seeing some of the projects put here by some users  i feel like i m publishing this here  but a part of me is satisfied with the work done so i took courage and here it is   premise  i am studying python through the book  python crash course  nd   i arrived at the chapter where we talk about data science and using csv files to create various examples of analysis  an exercise was to go to wunderground and download the csv file  but i was unable to find this file and i decided to do it differently   i know how to use python to do scraping then take data from a website and how to use pillow to work with images  so i created this program and here i leave an example of what it does  nothing special but nice     weather data from csv and wunderground com  hi everyone  this program is for analyzing monthly weather data from  wunderground com     start the program   to start the program you have to open the terminal and go to the  location where the files just downloaded are located  then just write   python main py    done this if the first time you open the program you will see this     x   b   https   preview redd it  iqia ik j    png width

1,hi everyone     the problem    i ve always had a hard time learning something new   since middle school  i never thought other people experienced the same problem  but i ve noticed on academic subs  there are often threads about the difficulty of learning in spite of many free educational contents online   it s weird  you have unlimited information on the web  but why can t you find better ways to process them  surely    the process of learning should be as equally important as the content     after contemplating for a while  my friends and i started to work on a   personal notes sharing website that uses mental models to help us learn faster    it s been more than a month since we started  we used it ourselves for school and work  it s been quite effective and got some requests to scale into a real thing   but before proceeding any further  we wanted to see if there s a real interest from the community     what s the theory       mental model      the feynman technique         named after the great physicist  richard feyenman       he used this technique to teach himself to become an admired scientist of our time       summarize information into your own words and share them to others as you d teach them    personal notes   collaboration         what if you didn t need to search extensively for that perfect summary that you finally understand       we used the feynman technique to summarize information into our own words and shared them       feedbacks given for improvements      a huge time saver      used others  notes when needed    solution      the feynman technique         create succinct notes online      auto summary to help condense information      attach an image for visual recall      share with others to improve the notes   collaboration through personal notes         save time by picking up others  notes      group feedback loop for improvements   other mental model tools for critical thinking         ie  first principle  popularized by elon musk       ie  active recall      ie  spaced learning      and more       looks    sample      sample screen  for auto summarizing information    the system    you would create an account for free access to all of the tools   content  we d like to provide as many mental models from the beginning  but most people aren t used to applying mental models often   so  you d experience the feynman technique first  create personal notes that fit your thinking  collaborate with others for feedback to improve each others  understanding  hence  a mind hive  there ll also be interactive tests  advanced mental models  and more     nuggets    people always say education is the problem  however  that isn t due to a lack of great educational content  a lot of the contents are free and excellent   ie  youtube  khan academy  wikipedia   what the world really lacks is a proper way to process them  which is what a mental model is all about   however  it s difficult to adopt a mental model as a normal way of thinking  so  we re trying to make it visual  ui  and fun  on top of that  if you can easily get processed notes and summarized information that can save you time from googling and watching hours of youtube videos  that s gravy     what do you think     we ve been using this tool just between our friends for school and work  not going to scale unless you guys are interested   because threads on this sub eventually disappear into an abyss  leaving no trace of our conversation  here s a google form for emails in case you want to follow more closely    link   google form   we ll send you an email to let you know if there are enough people interested  i ll post an update thread in the future as well for anyone who does not see this   if you have any questions or other ideas

improvements   other mental model tools for critical thinking         ie  first principle  popularized by elon musk       ie  active recall      ie  spaced learning      and more       looks    sample      sample screen  for auto summarizing information    the system    you would create an account for free access to all of the tools   content  we d like to provide as many mental models from the beginning  but most people aren t used to applying mental models often   so  you d experience the feynman technique first  create personal notes that fit your thinking  collaborate with others for feedback to improve each others  understanding  hence  a mind hive  there ll also be interactive tests  advanced mental models  and more     nuggets    people always say education is the problem  however  that isn t due to a lack of great educational content  a lot of the contents are free and excellent   ie  youtube  khan academy  wikipedia   what the world really lacks is a proper way to process them  which is what a mental model is all about   however  it s difficult to adopt a mental model as a normal way of thinking  so  we re trying to make it visual  ui  and fun  on top of that  if you can easily get processed notes and summarized information that can save you time from googling and watching hours of youtube videos  that s gravy     what do you think     we ve been using this tool just between our friends for school and work  not going to scale unless you guys are interested   because threads on this sub eventually disappear into an abyss  leaving no trace of our conversation  here s a google form for emails in case you want to follow more closely    link   google form   we ll send you an email to let you know if there are enough people interested  i ll post an update thread in the future as well for anyone who does not see this   if you have any questions or other ideas in mind  please leave a comment or email us at  neverblur com gmail com  mailto

1,hi  y all  it looks like i m starting at a new school in a few months  time  and i m trying to extract relevant information from a corresponding word s  dictionary com  page  however  i m running into a snag here and could use some feedback  the code below has two separate functions  one that downloads and crops slices the requested text  and the other that removes the html tags  the real issue i m running into is trying to find where to slice the page s source appropriately  as not every page seems to have the same layout   for instance    alleviate   shows the etymology and then

attendance  windows for now but might port it to mac later   the overly generalized flow of the program is as follows      login to the learning platform website and get links for adobe connect sessions  adobe connect is an online videoconferencing platform which has a desktop client      at appropriate times  launch adobe connect using the obtained links   i m done with the first step  but i m having problems with automating the second part  from the research that i ve done  adobe connect doesn t have an api for the client side  neither does it have a command line interface  but please do correct me if i m wrong   this leaves me with two options  but each of them has problems that i can t solve     option    browser automation using selenium     normally  when a user clicks the  join  link from their browser  it redirects them to the adobe connect website  from there  the user can either run connect in browser using flash  which i m trying to avoid at all costs   or they can launch connect from their browser directly  judging by my very surface knowledge of browser internals  this happens  because the user is redirected to a link that starts with  connectpro   which is the protocol for adobe connect  the browser then finds a locally installed program  which can handle the protocol and prompts the user whether they want to open connect   however  the prompt to open an external program from within chrome is not showing up in selenium ide recording  i think this is due to the prompt not being an alert window  such as one that you get by calling  alert    in javascript   but a chrome subprocess  i don t know how to confirm this dialogue in any other way  how do i overcome this without resorting to gui automation     option    autopy gui automation     this option seems to be more straightforward  when we open connect  we insert the link in the appropriate textbox and click  continue    we then enter the user login info  which is known to us  because it s the same as learning platform info  and click  enter room    the biggest pitfall of this approach is that the screen resolutions and exact element positions are impossible to predict for different computers  also  i don t know how to confirm whether connect finished loading before entering user s login info  putting  time sleep     seems like a horrible idea  is there any library that i m not aware of that can do this for me     x   b   screenshots of adobe connect  i ve blurred out some parts to avoid trouble with the university        x   b   i d appreciate any help with any of

0,i am migrating an xml importer tool from php to go  the xml files that i have to parse are very loosely defined  both in terms of parent depth and in element naming   the common ground is that i have a parent element   or   levels from the top  and then child elements that i want to get into an array slice  element name mapping is provided from configuration for each xml during runtime  for example one xml file can be something like  element naming mapping  id  myid title  mytitle parent  parent child  mychild      xml  root       first           parent               mychild                   myid                                            myid                   mytitle                      title goes here                   mytitle                mychild               mychild                   myid                                            myid                   mytitle                      second title goes here                   mytitle                mychild            parent        first    root       and the second could be something like  element naming mapping  id  myalternateid title  myalternatetitle parent  alternateparent child  alternatechild      xml  alternateroot       alternatefirst           alternatesecond               alternateparent                   alternatechild                       myalternateid                                                    myalternateid                       myalternatetitle                          title goes here                       myalternatetitle                    alternatechild                   alternatechild                       myalternateid                                                    myalternateid                       myalternatetitle                          second title goes here                       myalternatetitle                    alternatechild                alternateparent            alternatesecond        alternatefirst    alternateroot       is it possible to marshal that kind structures   thanks in advance for your consideration and time,marshaling loosely defined xml files,0.12727272727272726,0.3742424242424242,-0.07692307692307693,0.2692307692307692,5.0,181.0,186.0,3.0,0.11025641025641025,0.36549145299145297,i am migrating an xml importer tool from php to go  the xml files that i have to parse are very loosely defined  both in terms of parent depth and in element naming   the common ground is that i have a parent element   or   levels from the top  and then child elements that i want to get into an array slice  element name mapping is provided from configuration for each xml during runtime  for example one xml file can be something like  element naming mapping  id  myid title  mytitle parent  parent child  mychild      xml  root       first           parent               mychild                   myid                                            myid                   mytitle                      title goes here                   mytitle                mychild               mychild                   myid                                            myid                   mytitle                      second title goes here                   mytitle                mychild            parent        first    root       and the second could be something like  element naming mapping  id  myalternateid title  myalternatetitle parent  alternateparent child  alternatechild      xml  alternateroot       alternatefirst           alternatesecond               alternateparent                   alternatechild                       myalternateid                                                    myalternateid                       myalternatetitle                          title goes here                       myalternatetitle                    alternatechild                   alternatechild                       myalternateid                                                    myalternateid                       myalternatetitle                          second title goes here                       myalternatetitle                    alternatechild                alternateparent            alternatesecond        alternatefirst    alternateroot       is it possible to marshal that kind structures   thanks in advance for your consideration and timemarshaling loosely defined xml files

some other work  all of which can fail   i register my routes like      srv r handlefunc   api foo    srv getfoo  methods  get    and then i created a helper function to reduce the amount of

0,a massive shout out to sacado  on hackernews   imagine we re working together and i have some text document i want you to work on and update  if i send you the text by email  i send a  copy  of it  the original text is still on my computer   if you modify that copy and keep it for you  i won t ever know what you did  i just used a function         func  c coworker  sendforupdates d document                        that wouldn t make sense  you worked hard and i don t even know what you did  so  what i would expect you to do is  once you made updates on the copy  to send me back that copy by email  that would be akin to         func  c coworker  sendforupdates d document  document                       return d         i sent you a copy  and you returned another updated copy  that is  pass by value   the default  no pointer style   now  let s say i think those emails back and forth and boring  rather than sending you a copy of the text each time  i could rather use google docs  and send you the  link  to that document  its url  rather than a copy of its content  now  you can just go to that url and do the updates on the document  you don t have to send me back the document  you re working on it  not on a copy of it  well  that url is a reference to the document rather than the document itself  or  if you prefer  a  pointer  to it  so  now  the function would be         func  c coworker  sendforupdates d  document                        and we re done  no more back and forth dance now  that is  pass by reference    you don t only use  pass by reference  just to be able to check updates on the document sent  by the way  if i want to send you some text just for your information and i don t expect any kind of update  i ll use pass by value  the very first function   but what if i want to send you a   gb video  i can t send that through e mail  sending a copy would be totally inefficient  once again  i ll send you a pointer  an url to download the video          func  c coworker  informtext d document     d is small  pass by value      func  c coworker  informbigvideo v  video     videos are huge  pass by reference   why not use pointers everywhere by default  they seem easier  right  that s basically what java and python do  well  they can be tricky too  i gave you the url to the link and you could work on it  once you re done  i don t want you to modify the document anymore  i want to send it to our boss  but  how could i know you didn t keep the url somewhere in your bookmarks  how do i know  of all the coworkers i sent the url to  one of them doesn t keep on updating that document even when i don t want to anymore  with copies  i m safe  do whatever the hell you want with your copy  i don t care anymore  but a reference to the original document  that can be dangerous       link to full discussion   ,the best description on when to use a pointer and when to pass by value in go i ve seen

won t ever know what you did  i just used a function         func  c coworker  sendforupdates d document                        that wouldn t make sense  you worked hard and i don t even know what you did  so  what i would expect you to do is  once you made updates on the copy  to send me back that copy by email  that would be akin to         func  c coworker  sendforupdates d document  document                       return d         i sent you a copy  and you returned another updated copy  that is  pass by value   the default  no pointer style   now  let s say i think those emails back and forth and boring  rather than sending you a copy of the text each time  i could rather use google docs  and send you the  link  to that document  its url  rather than a copy of its content  now  you can just go to that url and do the updates on the document  you don t have to send me back the document  you re working on it  not on a copy of it  well  that url is a reference to the document rather than the document itself  or  if you prefer  a  pointer  to it  so  now  the function would be         func  c coworker  sendforupdates d  document                        and we re done  no more back and forth dance now  that is  pass by reference    you don t only use  pass by reference  just to be able to check updates on the document sent  by the way  if i want to send you some text just for your information and i don t expect any kind of update  i ll use pass by value  the very first function   but what if i want to send you a   gb video  i can t send that through e mail  sending a copy would be totally inefficient  once again  i ll send you a pointer  an url to download the video          func  c coworker  informtext d document     d is small  pass by value      func  c coworker  informbigvideo v  video     videos are huge  pass by reference   why not use pointers everywhere by default  they seem easier  right  that s basically what java and python do  well  they can be tricky too  i gave you the url to the link and you could work on it  once you re done  i don t want you to modify the document anymore  i want to send it to our boss  but  how could i know you didn t keep the url somewhere in your bookmarks  how do i know  of all the coworkers i sent the url to  one of them doesn t keep on updating that document even when i don t want to anymore  with copies  i m safe  do whatever the hell you want with your copy  i don t care anymore  but a reference to the original document  that can be dangerous       link to full discussion   the best description on when to use a pointer and when to pass by value in go i ve seen

0,hi  i m looking for an answer about how does slice capacity work  in other words  how does underline array increases when we append to the slice   i understand this example  a little         s    make   int          fmt printf  len  d  cap  d n   len s   cap s     len    cap             s   append s                   fmt printf  len  d  cap  d n   len s   cap s     len    cap              s   append s             fmt printf  len  d  cap  d n   len s   cap s     len    cap     i initialized empty slice             with capacity    than i m trying to append more values than initial capacity  so capacity is being twiced     new values            anyway  i still don t get  why capacity could not be     the last  append  also doubles array capacity  but  i m sure  the reason is not the same as it is for the first  append   probably it s because  current length    amount of new values      current capacity       docs  says  that   the cap built in function returns the capacity of v  according to its type         slice  the maximum length the slice can reach when resliced   but what is  reslicing    thank you in advance ,yet another one question about slice capacity,0.0854020979020979,0.3844599844599845,0.0,0.0,7.0,187.0,194.0,7.0,0.0854020979020979,0.3844599844599845,hi  i m looking for an answer about how does slice capacity work  in other words  how does underline array increases when we append to the slice   i understand this example  a little         s    make   int          fmt printf  len  d  cap  d n   len s   cap s     len    cap             s   append s                   fmt printf  len  d  cap  d n   len s   cap s     len    cap              s   append s             fmt printf  len  d  cap  d n   len s   cap s     len    cap     i initialized empty slice             with capacity    than i m trying to append more values than initial capacity  so capacity is being twiced     new values            anyway  i still don t get  why capacity could not be     the last  append  also doubles array capacity  but  i m sure  the reason is not the same as it is for the first  append   probably it s because  current length    amount of new values      current capacity       docs  says  that   the cap built in function returns the capacity of v  according to its type         slice  the maximum length the slice can reach when resliced   but what is  reslicing    thank you in advance yet another one question about slice capacity

0,what s the most practical way to keep tags out of the domain   let s say you have a domain struct for account creation input       type signupinfo struct       email string     password string           which gets passed to some domain account editing function       func create storage storage  info  signupinfo  error                  return nil        and in transport we re using json  so it s tempting and practical to just add the tags to the domain type       type signupinfo struct       email string  json  email       password string  json  password          now ideally this transport implementation coupling is hidden away  within a json package or somewhere else out of the domain   one option is to make the domain type an interface       type signupinfo interface       email   string     password   string           but this is awkward since using the pod types is much more natural and straightforward and the  create  function has little reason to need an interface instead of the plain data  this approach begs the case of why plain data should ever be accepted in any function  versus an interface or lambda returning the data   another option is to mirror the struct in a implementation folder definition  and provide a conversion utility to make it easy to pass to the domain  e g  in account internal json data go       type signupinfo struct       email string  json

 this works well enough  but for me the coupling on the json tags in the domain has never produced a problem worth the extra effort of doing this for all domain inputs that have tags associated with them used in other layers  not to mention the extra object creation overhead   is there another approach that somehow deals with this without the extra effort   i wouldn t mind if tags could be added

check if this field is sent or not  in some instances it is expected that a user with send just  onemsg name   this is a severely trimmed version of what the message actually is     i want to validate that the age field is required when there is a certain type  what i m seeing is that when a message comes through without the age field  golang will default this int to a    age is a bad example  but for this int i will be considering   as a valid value  so checking for   will not be a valid test  and i did some research and it looks like if that type is a pointer and empty it will evaluate to nil  which works for me in terms of validation    my issue with that approach is when i convert this message back to struct  one  to store in the db  i do the conversion like so      a   one        name

0,i am trying to create a program that is made of a couple of executables  and i tried making some packages that would share functionality between the executables to cut down on repeating functions   one of the packages handles network connections  once it does some handling on the connection  it would hand off a network message to a function that interprets that information  that interpretation part is particular to the executable  so i was writing a function for each of those executables that would do the interpretations  and thought i could send their interpretation function as a parameter to the network package function   i was able to create  in the package  a       type command func string   string error   then in the signature create  in the package  a parameter of  commandinterpret command  and it seemed happy to compile  that package would then call commandinterpret networkclientmessage  to get the task done and receive the results as a string and an error  if any   except i can t pass the function  because in the executable main package  i have to pass a string to the package function and it doesn t like that it has an assignment mismatch because i m passing the argument  function  and it can t return the  string error   i m not sure  but i think if the type didn t pass a string and return a  string  error  it might compile   but that doesn t seem like it s very useful  maybe passing functions to functions only works within the same package   at this point i m assuming i m taking the wrong route in trying to pass the function this way  maybe it s not possible at all  or is there   summary  i want to create a generic function placeholder with a signature into a package so individual programs can have custom functions to handle a particular task but use the same package for some common work  but i can t get that function passed to the package without errors in compilation  suggestions ,passing a function as a parameter in another package ,0.06152777777777779,0.49079861111111117,0.0,0.0,9.0,336.0,345.0,14.0,0.06152777777777779,0.49079861111111117,i am trying to create a program that is made of a couple of executables  and i tried making some packages that would share functionality between the executables to cut down on repeating functions   one of the packages handles network connections  once it does some handling on the connection  it would hand off a network message to a function that interprets that information  that interpretation part is particular to the executable  so i was writing a function for each of those executables that would do the interpretations  and thought i could send their interpretation function as a parameter to the network package function   i was able to create  in the package  a       type command func string   string error   then in the signature create  in the package  a parameter of  commandinterpret command  and it seemed happy to compile  that package would then call commandinterpret networkclientmessage  to get the task done and receive the results as a string and an error  if any   except i can t pass the function  because in the executable main package  i have to pass a string to the package function and it doesn t like that it has an assignment mismatch because i m passing the argument  function  and it can t return the  string error   i m not sure  but i think if the type didn t pass a string and return a  string  error  it might compile   but that doesn t seem like it s very useful  maybe passing functions to functions only works within the same package   at this point i m assuming i m taking the wrong route in trying to pass the function this way  maybe it s not possible at all  or is there   summary  i want to create a generic function placeholder with a signature into a package so individual programs can have custom functions to handle a particular task but use the same package for some common work  but i can t get that function passed to the package without errors in compilation  suggestions passing a function as a parameter in another package

0,hi everyone   i like how many ides like goland and vscode have capabilities for quick find where you can find files based on their file names or file paths   it saves a lot of time  compared to wandering around in the file directory tree on the left   and as most of you working on github probably know when reviewing pull requests there s a copy to clipboard button on each file you re reviewing   this way you can quickly go to the ide and through quick find go to that file  i do that a lot when reviewing   switching back and forth between browser and ide   but i found that that s not the most optimal flow when doing code review so i created a chrome browser extension called   line clipper for github    my first browser extension ever actually  which allows you to simply click on any line number and you ll get copied to your clipboard not only the file path  but also the line number suffixed to that  so you can go to that specific place in code in your ide  i find this saves me a lot of time and doesn t break my focus   maybe github will eventually implement something similar natively  but for now there s no such thing   by the way  this could possibly come in hand to some fuzzy finder terminal users  it s not necessarily ide specific   i d love to hear your opinions and also welcome contributions to the open source project    chrome web store    thanks    , effortlessly navigate between browser and ide while working on github,0.19318181818181818,0.46093073593073597,0.0,0.0,10.0,255.0,265.0,8.0,0.19318181818181818,0.46093073593073597,hi everyone   i like how many ides like goland and vscode have capabilities for quick find where you can find files based on their file names or file paths   it saves a lot of time  compared to wandering around in the file directory tree on the left   and as most of you working on github probably know when reviewing pull requests there s a copy to clipboard button on each file you re reviewing   this way you can quickly go to the ide and through quick find go to that file  i do that a lot when reviewing   switching back and forth between browser and ide   but i found that that s not the most optimal flow when doing code review so i created a chrome browser extension called   line clipper for github    my first browser extension ever actually  which allows you to simply click on any line number and you ll get copied to your clipboard not only the file path  but also the line number suffixed to that  so you can go to that specific place in code in your ide  i find this saves me a lot of time and doesn t break my focus   maybe github will eventually implement something similar natively  but for now there s no such thing   by the way  this could possibly come in hand to some fuzzy finder terminal users  it s not necessarily ide specific   i d love to hear your opinions and also welcome contributions to the open source project    chrome web store    thanks     effortlessly navigate between browser and ide while working on github
