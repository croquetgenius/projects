    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the GetOldTweets3 (GOT3) library to pull tweets from certain locations within a given timeline for comparative COVID-19 sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In choosing our timeline, we focused on the period when the highest number of states were implementing the strictest versions of their lockdown policies. According to the timeline source link in the readme, this began on April 8. We decided to end our timeline on April 30, since May 1 was when many states began to relax (or plan to relax) their measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our target locations were determined in a couple of ways:\n",
    "1. We picked states based on data put together on www.wallethub.com that ranked each U.S. state (and D.C.) by how \"aggressive\" the state's measures were in response to COVID-19. (Conveniently, this data was put together on April 7, almost exactly the day our timeline begins.) Using wallethub's ranking system (their methodology can be read in depth and is linked in the readme), we chose the top 10 and bottom 10 states ranked by COVID response severity. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because searching tweets by location with GOT3 is most effectively done by city, we then chose the largest city in each of our 20 states to serve as a proxy for the states' lockdown policies, or lack thereof. Our thinking here is that urban areas will offer a high concentration of tweets to collect, and larger cities' policies are most likely to resemble guidelines set by the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though our goal is to compare sentiments in tweets posted from different states, we also wanted to see how these sentiments compared to non-pandemic times. To most accurately do this, we pulled tweets from the same time line (April 8-30) for 2019. We also wanted to see how people under different lockdown policies were tweeting about the pandemic specifically. To this end, we pulled three sets of data from Twitter:\n",
    "1. Tweets by location/date 2020\n",
    "2. Tweets by location/date 2019\n",
    "3. Tweets by location/date 2020 w/ COVID-19 related keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part of this notebook pulls in COVID-19 infection and death count data from healthdata.org and cdc.gov. The infection data is by day, whereas the death data is by week; both are separated by state."
